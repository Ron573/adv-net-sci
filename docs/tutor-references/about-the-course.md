## Course Philosophy

Networks are ubiquitous - from Internet infrastructure to social connections, biological systems to transportation networks. When abstracted as "dots connected by lines," seemingly different systems reveal universal patterns and principles. This course provides the toolkit to study these systems across domains, finding common mathematical foundations beneath diverse real-world applications.

The course emphasizes **feeling** concepts through direct interaction with data and tools, building intuitive understanding before formal theory. Students learn to think like network scientists, seeing connection patterns in complex systems and applying rigorous analytical methods to unlock their secrets.
