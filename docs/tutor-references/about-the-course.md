**Bonus (30% total):** Best project (10%), best Network of Week presentation (10%), best Q&A assignments (10% - 2% each, unlimited recipients)

**Course Structure - "Don't think! Feel" (Bruce Lee philosophy):**
- Weekly Brightspace quiz on previous week's topics
- Biweekly coding assignments via Github Classroom
- Short theoretical lectures
- Focus on feeling concepts through pen-and-paper exercises and hands-on coding

**Communications:** Discord for informal Q&A/discussions (invitation via Brightspace), Brightspace for announcements. Missing Discord = missing course information.

**Office Hours:** 
- Kojaku: Fri 10:00-14:00 (J19 Engineering or Zoom: https://binghamton.zoom.us/my/skojaku.zoom)
- Also: Tue/Thu 14:30-16:30

**Important Dates:**

- Project Presentation: 12/05
- Final Exam: 12/08-12/12

**Key Policies:**
- **Attendance:** Email excuse 1 day prior (illness/accidents/interviews/conferences only); 2+ week absences need accommodation request
- **Devices:** No laptops/phones unless instructed
- **Credit hours:** 3 credits = 6.5 hours/week additional work expected
- **AI:** Permitted as learning aids; must cite generated parts (MLA format: https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/)
- **Data backup:** Student responsibility; use Google Drive/Dropbox minimum, ideally Github
