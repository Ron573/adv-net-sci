# Exam Generation Tools

This directory contains tools for generating exam materials from JSON question banks.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- JSON question bank file formatted as specified below

## JSON Format

The question bank should be a JSON file containing an array of question objects with this structure:

```json
{
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "options": ["London", "Paris", "Berlin", "Madrid"],
    "correct_answer": 1
}
```

## Generate Quiz images

1. To generate images for the quiz, run the following command:

    ```bash
    python generate_marp.py
    ```

    This will create a markdown file to generate a marp presentation, a slide per question.

2. Convert the markdown to a pdf using marp by running the following command:

    ```bash
    mkdir images
    convert -density 300 quiz_slides.pdf -quality 100 images/output_%d.jpg
    ```

3. Upload the images to Brightspace

4. Import the quiz into Brightspace using the CSV file generated by the following command:

    ```bash
    python json2csv_brightspace.py
    ```
