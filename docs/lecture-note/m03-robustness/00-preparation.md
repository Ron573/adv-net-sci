# Preparation: Network Failure Analysis Prerequisites

## Required Knowledge from Previous Modules

Before studying network robustness, ensure you understand:
- **From M01**: Basic graph representations and connectivity concepts
- **From M02**: Shortest path calculations and average path length measurement

## Graph Theory Prerequisites for Robustness Analysis

### Tree Structures
Understanding **tree** structures is essential for robustness analysis:
- **Tree**: A connected graph with no cycles
- **Spanning Tree**: A tree that connects all nodes in a graph
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: The spanning tree with minimum total edge weight

Trees are important because they represent the minimal connectivity structure - removing any edge disconnects the network.

### Network Connectivity Measures

#### Connectivity Robustness
- **Node connectivity**: Minimum number of nodes that must be removed to disconnect the network
- **Edge connectivity**: Minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the network
- **Cut sets**: Sets of edges or nodes whose removal increases the number of components

#### Centrality and Vulnerability
Understanding which nodes are most important for network connectivity:
- High-degree nodes often play crucial roles in network connectivity
- Removing central nodes may have disproportionate impact on network function

## Statistical Prerequisites

### Probability and Random Processes
For understanding different types of network attacks:
- **Random sampling**: Understanding uniform random selection of nodes/edges
- **Probability distributions**: How failure events are distributed
- **Expected values**: Average behavior under random failures

### Network Models for Comparison
- **Random graphs**: As baseline models to compare robustness
- **Scale-free networks**: Understanding degree heterogeneity effects
- **Small-world networks**: Balancing local and global connectivity

## Computational Prerequisites

### Algorithm Analysis
- **Efficiency considerations**: How to efficiently test connectivity after node/edge removal
- **Simulation methods**: Running multiple trials of failure scenarios
- **Measurement techniques**: Quantifying network performance degradation

### Data Structures for Dynamic Networks
- Efficient representations for networks that change over time
- Methods for tracking connected components as network is modified

## Application Context

### Infrastructure Networks
Basic understanding of real-world networks that must remain functional:
- **Power grids**: Electrical distribution networks
- **Transportation networks**: Road, rail, and air traffic systems
- **Communication networks**: Internet and telecommunication systems

These prerequisites will help you understand how different network structures respond to various types of failures and attacks.
