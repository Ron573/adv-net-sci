Namely, if we remove the hub preferentially, the network can be quickly disconnected into small components.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Degree heterogeneity**: As we have seen in the percolation theory, the more heterogeneous the degree distribution is, the more likely the network is to have a giant component.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Resilience to hub removal**: A network is vulnerable to targeted attacks if the removal of a single node significantly decreases the heterogeneity of the degree distribution. The most susceptible structure is a star graph, where a central node connects to all other nodes, as removing this central node will disconnect the network.\n",

        "A bimodal degree distribution can enhance network robustness against both random failures and targeted attacks.\n",
        "In this setup, $(1-r)$ portion of nodes have a degree of 1, while $r$ portion of nodes have a high degree, $k_{\\text{max}}$.\n",
        "This structure ensures that the network remains connected even if a hub is removed, as other hubs maintain the connectivity. It also withstands random failures due to its heterogeneous degree distribution.\n",
