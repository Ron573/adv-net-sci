# Module 5: Clustering

## What to learn in this module

In this module, we will learn community detection, one of the most widely-used yet controversial techniques in network analysis. We will learn:
- What is community structure in networks?
- How to operationalize community structure?
- How to find communities in networks?
- Limitations of community detection
- **Keywords**: community detection, assortativity, modularity, resolution limit, rugged landscape, random graph, label switching algorithm, Louvain algorithm, stochastic block model, the configuration model.
