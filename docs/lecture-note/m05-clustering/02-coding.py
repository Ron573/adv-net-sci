    When it comes to maximizing modularity, there are a variety of algorithms to choose from.
    Two of the most popular ones are the `Louvain` and `Leiden` algorithms, both of which are implemented in `igraph`. The Louvain algorithm has been around for quite some time and is a classic choice, while the Leiden algorithm is a newer bee that often yields better accuracy. For our example, we'll be using the `Leiden` algorithm, and I think you'll find it really effective!

    What is `resolution`? It is a parameter that helps us tackle the resolution limit of the modularity maximization algorithm {footcite}`fortunato2007resolution`!
    In simple terms, when we use the resolution parameter $\rho$, the modularity formula can be rewritten as
     follow:

    $$
    Q(M) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \left(A_{ij} - \rho \frac{k_i k_j}{2m}\right) \delta(c_i, c_j)
    $$

    Here, the parameter $\rho$ plays a crucial role in balancing the positive and negative parts of the equation.
    The resolution limit comes into play because of the diminishing effect of the negative term as the number of edges $m$ increases.
    The parameter $\rho$ can adjust this balance and allow us to circumvent the resolution limit.

    - Think of a major international airport (the core) and smaller regional airports (the periphery).
    - Major international airports have many flights connecting to each other (densely connected).
