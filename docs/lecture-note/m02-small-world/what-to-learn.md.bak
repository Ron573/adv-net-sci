# Module 2: Small-world

## What to learn in this module

In this module, we will learn small-world experiments and conduct a small small-world experiment . We will learn:
- Small-world experiment by Milgram
- Different concepts of *distance*: path, walks, circuits, cycles, connectedness
- How to load a large sparse network efficiently into memory
- How to measure a *distance* between two nodes using `igraph`
- **Keywords**: small-world experiment, six degrees of separation, path, walks, circuits, cycles, connectedness, connected component, weakly connected component, strongly connected component, compressed sparse row format.
