## Convenient libraries for network analysis

The Python ecosystem offers several powerful libraries for network analysis, each with distinct strengths:

- [networkx](https://networkx.org/) - a beginner-friendly library for network analysis
- [igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) - a mature library with a wide range of algorithms
- [graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/) - specialized for stochastic block models
- [scipy](https://scipy.org/) - efficient tools for analyzing large networks

Throughout this course, we'll primarily use `igraph`, a mature and robust library originally developed for R and later ported to Python. While `networkx` is by far the most popular library, `igraph` offers several compelling advantages for serious network analysis: it provides more reliable algorithm implementations (avoiding persistent bugs found in some `networkx` functions like LFR benchmark and weighted degree assortativity), and its optimized C core delivers the performance needed for large-scale network computations.

**Installing igraph**

```bash
# Using pip (with plotting support)
pip install igraph cairocffi

# Using conda (recommended)
conda install -c conda-forge igraph cairocffi

# Alternative plotting backend
pip install igraph pycairo

# For development version
pip install git+https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph.git
```

Note: igraph requires compiled C libraries and plotting needs `cairocffi` or `pycairo`. Use conda for easier installation.
:::

For advanced users comfortable with `scipy`, the `csgraph` submodule provides an excellent alternative that leverages one of Python's most well-tested and optimized libraries. For example, `csgraph.shortest_path` and `csgraph.connected_components` offer high-performance implementations.

### Create a graph

Let us create a graph of 4 nodes and 4 edges. Our edge list is given by

```{python}
edge_list = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3)]
```

`igraph` has an object `Graph` that stores a graph and provides methods to manipulate and analyze the graph. To create a graph from an edge list, we can use the `add_edges` method.

```{python}
import igraph

g = igraph.Graph() # Create an empty graph
g.add_vertices(4) # Add 4 vertices
g.add_edges(edge_list) # Add edges to the graph

# Plot the graph
igraph.plot(g, bbox=(150, 150), vertex_label=list(range(4)))
```

### Shortest Paths

Let's compute the paths between nodes 2 and 3.

```{python}
g.get_all_simple_paths(2, to=3)
```

This method enumerates all possible simple paths between two nodes. This is OK for small networks but quickly becomes impractical for larger networks, as the number of paths increases exponentially with the size of the network.

Often, we are interested in the shortest path, which is the path with the smallest number of edges. The shortest path can be computed by using the `get_shortest_paths` method.

```{python}
g.get_shortest_paths(2, to=3)
```

Note that there can be multiple shortest paths between two nodes. If we are interested in the "length" instead of the path itself, there is a more efficient function `distances`.

```{python}
g.distances(2, 3)
```

### Connected Components

In the simple network above, we can see that for every pair of nodes, we can find a path connecting them. This is the definition of a connected graph. We can check this property for a given graph:

```{python}
components = g.connected_components()
```

The `components` is a special object called [VertexClustering](https://python.igraph.org/en/0.11.6/api/igraph.VertexClustering.html) in `igraph`.
It has the following useful functions and attributes:

```{python}
print("membership: ", components.membership)  # the IDs of the component each node belongs to.
print("sizes: ", list(components.sizes()))  # the number of nodes in each component.
print("giant: ", components.giant())  # a subgraph of the largest connected component.
```

##### Exercise 01 üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí™üß†

1. Now, let us add two nodes that are not connected to the existing graph, and call `connected_components` again. üîó‚ûï

2. Call `get_shortest_paths` between the two new nodes in different connected components. üõ£Ô∏èüîç

3. Get the largest connected component. üåêüèÜ

```{python}

```

### Directed networks
Let's extend these ideas about paths and connected components to directed graphs.

```{python}
edge_list =[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 3)]
g = igraph.Graph(directed=True)
g.add_vertices(6)
g.add_edges(edge_list)
igraph.plot(g, bbox=(250, 250), vertex_label=list(range(6)))
```

In directed graphs, edges and paths can be one-way. For instance, in our graph, you can go from node 0 to node 3, but not from 3 to 0.

```{python}
print("From 0 to 3", g.get_all_simple_paths(0, to=3))
print("From 3 to 0", g.get_all_simple_paths(3, to=0))
```

The shortest path from 4 to 1 must take a longer route due to edge directions.
```{python}
g.get_shortest_paths(4, 1)
```

Directed networks have two kinds of connected components.

- **Strongly connected components:** Strongly connected means that there exists a direct path between every pair of nodes, i.e., that from any node to any other nodes while respecting the edge directionality.
- **Weakly connected components:** Weakly connected means that there exists a path between every pair of nodes when ignoring the edge directionality.

```{python}
print(list(g.connected_components(mode="strong")))
print(list(g.connected_components(mode="weak")))
```

## Exercise 02 üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí™üß†

Let's compute the average path length of a network from pre-existing data and check if how long on average it takes to go from any node to any other node.

1. Select a network of your choice from [Netzschleuder](https://networks.skewed.de/). For convenience, choose a network of nodes less than 5000.
2. Download the csv version of the data by clicking something like "3KiB" under `csv` column.
3. Unzip the file and find "edges.csv", open it with a text editor to familiarize yourself with the format.
4. Load the data using `pandas`.
5. Get the source and target nodes from the data to create an edge list.
6. Construct a graph from the edge list, either using `igraph` or `scipy`.
7. Compute the average path length

**Hint:** Finding all shortest paths is a qubic time operation with respect to the number of nodes, or simply put, it takes a long time to compute. So compute the "estimate" by sampling many pairs of nodes uniformly at random and computing the average path length.
