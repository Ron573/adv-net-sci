## Erdős-Rényi Random Graphs

The Erdős-Rényi random graph model is one of the fundamental models in network science. There are two variants:
- $G(n,m)$: $n$ vertices with exactly $m$ randomly chosen edges
- $G(n,p)$: $n$ vertices where each possible edge exists with probability $p$

We focus on the $G(n,p)$ model for analytical tractability.

### Clustering Coefficient for Erdős-Rényi Random Graphs

The clustering coefficient measures the probability that two neighbors of a vertex are also connected to each other. For Erdős-Rényi random graphs, we can derive the expected clustering coefficient analytically.

### Local Clustering Coefficient

For a vertex $i$ with degree $k_i$, the local clustering coefficient is:

$$C_i = \frac{2e_i}{k_i(k_i-1)}$$

where $e_i$ is the number of edges between neighbors of vertex $i$.

### Expected Clustering Coefficient

In an Erdős-Rényi random graph $G(n,p)$:
- Each possible edge exists with probability $p$
- For a vertex with $k$ neighbors, there are $\binom{k}{2} = \frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ possible edges between its neighbors
- Each of these potential edges exists with probability $p$

Therefore, the expected number of edges between neighbors is:
$$E[e_i | k_i = k] = \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \cdot p$$

The expected local clustering coefficient for a vertex with degree $k$ is:
$$E[C_i | k_i = k] = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \cdot p}{k(k-1)} = p$$

### Global Clustering Coefficient

Since the expected local clustering coefficient is $p$ for all vertices (regardless of their degree), the expected global clustering coefficient is also:

$$E[C] = p = \frac{\langle k \rangle}{n-1}$$

where $\langle k \rangle = p(n-1)$ is the expected degree.

### Key Insights

1. The clustering coefficient of Erdős-Rényi graphs is independent of network size
2. It equals the edge probability $p$
3. For sparse networks ($p \ll 1$), clustering is very low
4. Real-world networks typically have much higher clustering than random graphs with the same density

## Average Path Length in Erdős-Rényi Random Graphs

The average path length in Erdős-Rényi graphs can be derived using a tree-expansion argument.

### Tree Expansion Analysis

Given an Erdős-Rényi model with average degree $\bar{k}$, we can analyze the network structure by treating it as a tree rooted at any node:

- **1st step**: From the root, we can reach $1 + \bar{k}$ nodes
- **2nd step**: We can reach $1 + \bar{k} + \bar{k}^2$ nodes  
- **h-th step**: We can reach $1 + \bar{k} + \bar{k}^2 + \ldots + \bar{k}^h \approx \bar{k}^h$ nodes

### Diameter Calculation

Since Erdős-Rényi random graphs have few triangles and local clusters, most nodes are reached only at the final step of the expansion. Therefore:

$$\bar{k}^h \approx n$$

Solving for $h$:

$$h \approx \log_{\bar{k}}(n) = \frac{\log(n)}{\log(\bar{k})} = \frac{\log(n)}{\log(p(n-1))}$$

### Result

The average shortest path length (diameter) of an Erdős-Rényi graph scales logarithmically with network size:

$$\langle d \rangle \approx \frac{\log(n)}{\log(\bar{k})}$$

This demonstrates the "small-world" property: even in large networks, the typical distance between nodes grows only logarithmically with network size.
