## Clustering Coefficient for Erdős-Rényi Random Graphs

The clustering coefficient measures the probability that two neighbors of a vertex are also connected to each other. For Erdős-Rényi random graphs, we can derive the expected clustering coefficient analytically.

### Local Clustering Coefficient

For a vertex $i$ with degree $k_i$, the local clustering coefficient is:

$$C_i = \frac{2e_i}{k_i(k_i-1)}$$

where $e_i$ is the number of edges between neighbors of vertex $i$.

### Expected Clustering Coefficient

In an Erdős-Rényi random graph $G(n,p)$:
- Each possible edge exists with probability $p$
- For a vertex with $k$ neighbors, there are $\binom{k}{2} = \frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ possible edges between its neighbors
- Each of these potential edges exists with probability $p$

Therefore, the expected number of edges between neighbors is:
$$E[e_i | k_i = k] = \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \cdot p$$

The expected local clustering coefficient for a vertex with degree $k$ is:
$$E[C_i | k_i = k] = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \cdot p}{k(k-1)} = p$$

### Global Clustering Coefficient

Since the expected local clustering coefficient is $p$ for all vertices (regardless of their degree), the expected global clustering coefficient is also:

$$E[C] = p = \frac{\langle k \rangle}{n-1}$$

where $\langle k \rangle = p(n-1)$ is the expected degree.

### Key Insights

1. The clustering coefficient of Erdős-Rényi graphs is independent of network size
2. It equals the edge probability $p$
3. For sparse networks ($p \ll 1$), clustering is very low
4. Real-world networks typically have much higher clustering than random graphs with the same density
