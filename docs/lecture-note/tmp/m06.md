# What is centrality?

Have you ever wondered who the most popular person in your school is? Or which idea is the most important in a subject? Or maybe which movie everyone's talking about right now?
These questions are all about finding out what's important in a network of people, ideas, or things. In network science, we call this *centrality.*

Centrality or *importance* is a question of how important a node is in a network.
But the notion of *importance* is somewhat vague.
In what sense we say a node is important?
Answering this question needs a specific *context*, and there are many contexts in which the *importance* is defined.

## Different centrality measures

Here we will focus on several popular centrality measures. Let us denote by $c_i$ the centrality of node $i$ throughout this section.
Here is a preview of the centrality measures we will cover in this section

| Centrality          | Category            | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Degree Centrality       | Degree              | Counts the number of edges connected to a node.                             |
| Closeness Centrality    | Shortest Path  | Measures how close a node is to all other nodes in the network.             |
| Eccentricity Centrality | Shortest Path  | Based on the maximum shortest path distance from a node to any other node.  |
| Harmonic Centrality     | Shortest Path  | Adjusts closeness centrality to work even in disconnected networks.         |
| Betweenness Centrality  | Shortest Path  | Measures the extent to which a node lies on paths between other nodes.      |
| Eigenvector Centrality  | Walk           | Measures a node's influence based on the influence of its neighbors.        |
| HITS (Hub and Authority) Centrality | Walk  | Measures the importance of nodes as hubs and authorities in a network.      |
| Katz Centrality         | Walk           | Considers the total number of walks between nodes, with a damping factor.   |
| PageRank                | Walk           | Measures the importance of nodes based on the structure of incoming links.  |


### Degree centrality

Perhaps the simplest form of cnetrality is *degree centrality*. It is just the count of the number of edges connected to a node (i.e., the number of neighbors, or *degree* in network science terminology). The most important node is thus the one with the highest degree.

$$
c_i = d_i = \sum_{j} A_{ij}
$$

where $A_{ij}$ is the adjacency matrix of the network, and $d_i$ is the degree of node $i$.

### Centrality based on shortest path


<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Milliarium_Aureum_op_het_Forum_Romanum_te_Rome_Columna_Miliaria_in_Foro_Romano_%28titel_op_object%29_Antieke_monumenten_%28serietitel%29_Antiquae_Urbis_Splendor_%28serietitel%29%2C_RP-P-2016-345-28-1.jpg/1546px-thumbnail.jpg?20191217151048" alt="Roma Foro Romano Miliarium Aureum" width="80%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">


Let's talk about an ancient Roman monument called the *Milliarium Aureum*, also known as the *Golden Milestone*.
It was the starting point for measuring distances on all major roads in the Roman Empire.
Emperor Augustus built it when Rome changed from a republic to an empire.
The monument not only marked the distances but also represent a centralization of power, where Rome transitioned from a Republic to an Empire.
Perhaps the Romans understood the importance of being central in terms of distance, and this concept can be applied to define *centrality* in networks.

### Closeness centrality
**Closenes centrality** is a measure of how close a node is to all other nodes in the network. A node is central if it is close to all other nodes, which is operationally defined as

$$
c_i = \frac{N - 1}{\sum_{j = 1}^N \text{shortest path length from } j \text{ to } i}
$$

where $N$ is the number of nodes in the network. The numerator, $N - 1$, is the normalization factor to make the centrality have a maximum value of 1.


```{admonition} Exercise
:class: tip

Create a graph where a node has the maximum closeness centrality of value 1.


```{dropdown} Click to see the answer

The simplest example is a star graph, where one node is connected to all other nodes. The node at the center has the highest closeness centrality.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_network_7.svg/1920px-Star_network_7.svg.png" alt="Star graph S7" width="50%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

```


### Harmonic centrality

**Harmonic Centrality** is a measure that adjusts closeness centrality to work even in disconnected networks. The problem with closeness centrality is that it cannot handle disconnected networks. When a network is disconnected, some nodes can't reach others, making their distance infinite. This causes all centrality values to become zero, which isn't very helpful!

To fix this, Beauchamp {footcite:p}`beauchamp1965improved` came up with a clever solution called *harmonic centrality*. It works even when the network is disconnected.

$$
c_i = \sum_{j\neq i} \frac{1}{\text{shortest path length from } j \text{ to } i}
$$

### Eccentricity centrality

**Eccentricity centrality** is baesd on the farthest distance from a node to any other node. The eccentricity centrality is defined as

$$
c_i = \frac{1}{\max_{j} \text{shortest path length from } i \text{ to } j}
$$


These centrality measures provide different perspectives on the importance of nodes based on their accessibility and reachability within the network.

A central node should be close to all other nodes.

Closeness centrality captures the notion of "centrality" in the network. Namely, a node is *central* if it is close to all other nodes.

$$
c_i = \frac{N - 1}{\sum_{j = 1}^N \text{shortest path length from } j \text{ to } i}
$$

where $N$ is the number of nodes in the network. The numerator, $N$, is the normalization factor to make the centrality to have the maximum value of 1.


### Eccentricity centrality

Eccentricity centrality is based on the shortest path distance between nodes, just like the closeness centrality, but it is based on the *maximum* distance as opposed to the average distance like in the closeness centrality.

$$
c_i = \frac{1}{\max_{j} \text{shortest path length from } i \text{ to } j}
$$


### Betweenness centrality

Another notion of centrality is *betweenness centrality*. It considers that a node is important if it lies on many shortest paths between other nodes.

$$
c_i = \sum_{j < k} \frac{\sigma_{jk}(i)}{\sigma_{jk}}
$$

where $\sigma_{jk}$ is the number of shortest paths between nodes $j$ and $k$, and $\sigma_{jk}(i)$ is the number of shortest paths between nodes $j$ and $k$ that pass through node $i$.

# Centralities based on centralities

"A man is known by the company he keeps" is a quote from Aesop who lived in the ancient Greece, a further back in time from the Roman Empire.
It suggests that a person's character is reflected by the people this person is friends with.
This idea can be applied to define the *centrality* of a node in a network.

## Eigenvector centrality

One considers that a node is important if it is connected to other important nodes. Yes, it sounds like circular! But it is actually computable! Let us define it more precisely by the following equation.

$$
c_i = \lambda \sum_{j} A_{ij} c_j
$$

where $\lambda$ is a constant. It suggests that the centrality of a node ($c_i$) is the sum of the centralities of its neighbors ($A_{ij} c_j$; note that $A_{ij}=1$ if $j$ is a neighbor, and otherwise $A_{ij}=0$), normalized by $\lambda$.
Using vector notation, we can rewrite the equation as

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
c_1 \\
c_2 \\
\vdots \\
c_n
\end{bmatrix} = \lambda
\begin{bmatrix}
A_{11} & A_{12} & \cdots & A_{1n} \\
A_{21} & A_{22} & \cdots & A_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
A_{n1} & A_{n2} & \cdots & A_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
c_1 \\
c_2 \\
\vdots \\
c_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

or equivalently,

$$
\mathbf{c} = \lambda \mathbf{A} \mathbf{c}
$$

Okay, but how do we solve this? Well, this is actually the eigenvector equation! And the solution to this equation is the eigenvector of the adjacency matrix, $\mathbf{A}$. But here's the tricky part - there are multiple eigenvectors. So which one should we choose?

Let's think about it for a moment. We want our centrality measure to be positive. It wouldn't make much sense to have negative importance! So, we're looking for an eigenvector where all the elements are positive. And a good news is that there's a special eigenvector that fits the bill perfectly.
Perron-Frobenius theorem guarantees that the eigenvector associted with the largest eigenvalue always has all positive elements.

This centrality is called **Eigenvector centrality**.


## Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) centrality

Eigenvector centrality has several problems. One is that it does not handle directed networks very well.
A natural extension of eigenvector centrality to directed networks is the HITS centrality.
It introduces two notions of importance: *hub* and *authority*. A node is an important hub if it points to many important *authorities*. A node is an important authority if it is pointed by many important *hubs*.

Let's put on a math hat to concretely define the hub and authority centralities.
We introduce two vectors, $x_i$ and $y_i$, to denote the hub and authority centralities of node $i$, respectively. Following the idea of eigenvector centrality, we can define the hub and authority centralities as follows:

$$
x_i = \lambda_x \sum_j A_{ji} y_j, \quad y_i = \lambda_y \sum_j A_{ij} x_j
$$

Or equivalently,

$$
\mathbf{x} = \lambda_x \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{y}, \quad \mathbf{y} = \lambda_y \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}
$$

Substituting $\mathbf{y} = \lambda_y \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}$ into the first equation and similar for $\mathbf{x}$, we get

$$
\mathbf{x} = \lambda_x \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}, \quad \mathbf{y} = \lambda_y \mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{y}
$$

Again, we obtain the eigenvector equations whose solutions are the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T$ for $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, respectively.

```{admonition} Exercise
:class: tip

If the original network is *undirected*, is the HITS centrality equivalent to the eigenvector centrality? If so or not, explain why.

```{dropdown} Click to see the answer
If the graph is undirected, the hub and authority centralities are equivalent. And the solution is given by the eigenvector of $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^T$. Now, let us consider the eigenvector equation for the adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$.

$$
\mathbf{c} = \lambda \mathbf{A} \mathbf{c}
$$

By multiplying $\mathbb{A}$ on the both sides, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{c} &= \lambda \mathbf{A} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{c} \\
\iff \mathbf{A}^\top \mathbf{A} \mathbf{c} &= \lambda \mathbf{A}^\top \mathbf{c} \\
\iff \mathbf{A}^\top \mathbf{A} \mathbf{c} &= \lambda^2 \mathbf{c}
\end{aligned}
$$

where we used the fact that $\mathbf{A}$ is symmetric. It suggests that the eigenvector of $\mathbf{A}^\top \mathbf{A}$ is the same as that of $\mathbf{A}$, and that the eigenvalue of $\mathbf{A}^\top \mathbf{A}$ is the square of that of $\mathbf{A}$.
Thus, the eigenvector centrality is equivalent to the HITS centrality if the network is undirected.

```

```{admonition} Exercise
:class: tip

Consider the case where the graph is undirected and we normalize the hub centrality by the degree $d_j$ of the authority, namely

$$
x_i = \sum_j \frac{A_{ji}}{d_j} y_j,\quad y_i = \sum_j A_{ij} x_j
$$


Then we will get the hub centrality equivalent to the degree centrality. Confirm this by substituting $x_i = d_i$.
```

## Katz centrality

Eigenvector centrality tends to pay too much attention to a small number of nodes that are well connected to the network while under-emphasizing the importance of the rest of the nodes. A solution is to add a little bit of score to all nodes.

$$
c_i = \beta + \lambda \sum_{j} A_{ij} c_j
$$

```{admonition} Exercise
:class: tip

Derive the solution of the Katz centrality.

```{dropdown} Click to see the answer

The equation can be solved by

$$
\mathbf{c} = \beta \mathbf{1} + \lambda \mathbf{A} \mathbf{c}
$$

where $\mathbf{1}$ is the vector of ones. By rewriting the equation, we get

$$
\left( \mathbf{I} - \lambda \mathbf{A} \right) \mathbf{c} = \beta \mathbf{1}
$$

By taking the inverse of $\mathbf{I} - \lambda \mathbf{A}$, we get

$$
\mathbf{c} = \beta \left( \mathbf{I} - \lambda \mathbf{A} \right)^{-1} \mathbf{1}
$$
```

## PageRank

You've probably heard PageRank, a celebrated idea behind Google Search. It is like a cousin of Katz centrality.

$$
c_i = (1-\beta) \sum_j A_{ji}\frac{c_j}{d^{\text{out}}_j} + \beta \cdot \frac{1}{N}
$$

where $d^{\text{out}}_j$ is the out-degree of node $j$ (the number of edges pointing out from node $j$).
The term $c_j/d^{\text{out}}_j$ represents that the score of node $j$ is divided by the number of nodes to which node $j$ points. In Web, this is like a web page distributes its score to the web pages it points to. It is based on an idea of traffic, where the viewers of a web page are evenly transferred to the linked web pages. A web page is important if it has a high traffic of viewers.

# Computing centrality with Python

## Network of university students

Let's compute the centrality of the network using Python igraph.

```python
# Uncomment if you use Colab
#!pip install igraph
```

```python
import igraph
names  = ['Sarah', 'Mike', 'Emma', 'Alex', 'Olivia', 'James', 'Sophia', 'Ethan', 'Ava', 'Noah', 'Lily', 'Lucas', 'Henry']
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12)]
g = igraph.Graph()
g.add_vertices(13)
g.vs["name"] = names
g.add_edges(edge_list)
igraph.plot(g, vertex_label=g.vs["name"])
```

`igraph` offers a wide range of centrality measures as methods of the `igraph.Graph` class.

- **Degree centrality**: `igraph.Graph.degree()`
- **Closeness centrality**: `igraph.Graph.closeness()`
- **Betweenness centrality**: `igraph.Graph.betweenness()`
- **Harmonic centrality**: `igraph.Graph.harmonic_centrality()`
- **Eccentricity**: `igraph.Graph.eccentricity()`
- **Eigenvector centrality**: `igraph.Graph.eigenvector_centrality()`
- **PageRank centrality**: `igraph.Graph.personalized_pagerank()`

For example, the closeness centrality is computed by

```python
g.closeness()
```

### Computing Katz centrality

Let's compute the Katz centrality without using igraph.
Let us first define the adjacency matrix of the graph

```python
A = g.get_adjacency_sparse()
```

which is the scipy CSR sparse matrix. The Katz centrality is given by

$$

\mathbf{c} = \beta \mathbf{1} + \alpha \mathbf{A} \mathbf{c}

$$

So, how do we solve this? We can use a linear solver but here we will use a simple method:

1. Initialize $\mathbf{c}$ with a random vector.
2. Compute the right hand side of the equation and update $\mathbf{c}$.
3. Repeat the process until $\mathbf{c}$ converges.

Let's implement this.

```python
import numpy as np

alpha, beta = 0.1, 0.05 # Hyperparameters
n_nodes = g.vcount() # number of nodes
c = np.random.rand(n_nodes, 1) # column random vector

for _ in range(100):
    c_next = beta * np.ones((n_nodes, 1)) + alpha * A * c
    if np.linalg.norm(c_next - c) < 1e-6:
        break
    c = c_next
print(c)
```

- Does the centrality converge?
- Change the hyperparameter and see how the result changes 😉
If the centrality diverges, think about why it diverges.

*Hint*: Katz centrality can be analytically computed by

$$

\mathbf{c} = \beta \left(\mathbf{I} -  \alpha \mathbf{A} \right)^{-1} \mathbf{1}

$$

### Exercise (Optional)

Compute the PageRank centrality of this graph

```python

```

## Network of ancient Roman roads

### Load the data & construct the network

```python
import pandas as pd

root = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skojaku/adv-net-sci/main/data/roman-roads"
node_table = pd.read_csv(f"{root}/node_table.csv")
edge_table = pd.read_csv(f"{root}/edge_table.csv")
```

The node table:

```python
node_table.head(3)
```

The edge table:

```python
edge_table.head(3)
```

Let's construct a network from the node and edge tables.

```python
import igraph

g = igraph.Graph() # create an empty graph
g.add_vertices(node_table["node_id"].values) # add nodes
g.add_edges(list(zip(edge_table["src"].values, edge_table["trg"].values))) # add edges
```

which looks like this:

```python
coord = list(zip(node_table["lon"].values, -node_table["lat"].values))
igraph.plot(g, layout = coord, vertex_size = 5)
```

### Exercise 🏛️

    - Katz centrality
    - Betweenness centrality
    - Closeness centrality
