# Welcome to SSIE 641 Advanced Topics on Network Science

``Don't think! Feeeeeel'' is a famous quote by Bruce Lee in the movie *Enter the Dragon*, and this is my guiding philosophy of learning.

This course is designed to help you *feel* the concepts and tools of network science through pen-and-paper exercises and hands-on coding.
