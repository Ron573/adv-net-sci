## What to learn in this module

In this module, we will explore the historical moment that gave birth to graph theory and modern network science. A simple Sunday stroll puzzle in an 18th-century Prussian city would spark a mathematical revolution that now powers everything from GPS navigation to social media algorithms.

Through Euler's elegant solution, we will learn:

- How to describe a network using mathematical language
- How mathematical abstraction reveals hidden structure in complex problems
- The power of degree-based reasoning in network analysis
- Keywords: **network**, **graph**, **degree**, **Euler walk**, **mathematical abstraction**

## A Sunday Stroll That Changed Mathematics

Back in the 18th century, there was a city called *K√∂nigsberg* situated on the Pregel River in what was then Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). The city was built around two large islands, beautifully connected to each other and the mainland by seven elegant bridges.

::: {.column-margin}
K√∂nigsberg was a major intellectual center of the Enlightenment. [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant) spent his entire life there, never traveling more than 10 miles from the city. The university attracted scholars from across Europe.
:::

During their leisurely Sunday walks, the citizens of K√∂nigsberg found themselves pondering an intriguing puzzle:


::: {.callout-note title="The K√∂nigsberg Bridge Problem"}
Is it possible to take a walk through the city that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point?

This seemingly innocent recreational question would become one of the most important problems in the history of mathematics. What made it revolutionary wasn't the answer, but ***how*** the answer was found.

## Try It Yourself First!

Before we reveal Euler's brilliant solution, **take some time to think about this problem yourself**. This is exactly how mathematical discovery works‚Äîby wrestling with puzzles and developing your own insights.

::: {.callout-tip title="Work Through It Step by Step"}
**Highly recommended**: Download and work through this excellent [pen-and-paper worksheet](http://estebanmoro.org/pdf/netsci_for_kids/the_konisberg_bridges.pdf) created by Esteban Moro [@esteban-moro-worksheet]. It guides you through Euler's reasoning step by step, letting you discover the solution yourself.

**Questions to consider while working:**

- Can you trace a path that crosses each bridge exactly once?
- What patterns do you notice when you try different routes?
- What properties of the landmasses seem important?
- How might you prove that something is impossible, rather than just failing to find it?
:::

The beauty of mathematics lies not just in the answers, but in the process of discovery.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pause Here First!

**Before reading Euler's solution below**, we strongly encourage you to:

1. **Work through the [pen-and-paper worksheet](http://estebanmoro.org/pdf/netsci_for_kids/the_konisberg_bridges.pdf)** by Esteban Moro
2. **Try the puzzle yourself** - can you find a path that crosses each bridge exactly once?
3. **Think about what makes this problem difficult** - what constraints do you notice?

The learning experience is much richer when you discover the insights yourself first!

## üîç Euler's Revolutionary Abstraction

[Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) approached this puzzle in 1736 with a stroke of genius that would define mathematical thinking for centuries. Instead of getting bogged down in the physical details‚Äîthe width of the bridges, the size of the islands, the beauty of the architecture‚Äîhe made a ***radical simplification***.

::: {.column-margin}
Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) was one of the most prolific mathematicians in history, contributing to nearly every area of mathematics. He lost sight in his right eye in 1738 but continued his work, producing almost half of his total output after becoming completely blind in 1766.

:::

This was revolutionary thinking for its time. Before Euler, mathematics focused on quantities, measurements, and calculations. Euler showed that sometimes the *relationships* between objects matter more than the objects themselves.

Euler realized that for this problem, only one thing mattered: ***which landmasses connect to which other landmasses***. Everything else‚Äîthe bridge lengths, island shapes, water depths‚Äîwas irrelevant distraction.

He simplified the city into *a network of landmasses connected by bridges*:

Euler's graph of the bridges of Knigsberg. Taken from  [The Essential Guide to Graph Theory: From an 18th Century Riddle to AI Frameworks](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-essential-guide-to-graph-theory-from-an-18th-century-riddle-to-artificial-intelligence-c441cb9400de/)

:::

This abstraction‚Äîreducing a complex physical system to its essential connectivity‚Äîwas the birth of ***graph theory***. Euler had invented a new mathematical language for describing relationships.

Once Euler had his abstract graph, he made another crucial insight. Instead of trying different walking routes (which would take forever), he focused on a fundamental property: ***how many bridges connect to each landmass?***

::: {.column-margin}
This shift from "trying all possibilities" to "analyzing constraints" is a hallmark of mathematical thinking. Instead of brute force, Euler used logical reasoning to prove impossibility.
:::

Euler considered the degree (number of connections) of each node and realized there were only two cases:
- a node has an **even number** of edges, or
- a node has an **odd number** of edges.

When a node has an even number $2k$ of edges, you can enter and leave the node exactly $k$ times by crossing different edges. Every time you enter through one bridge, you can leave through another. The bridges naturally pair up.

When a node has an odd number $2k+1$ of edges, you can enter and leave the node $k$ times, but one edge is left over. The only way to cross this last edge is if your journey ***starts or ends*** at this node.

::: {.column-margin}
Think of it like a dance where everyone needs a partner. In nodes with even degree, every bridge has a "partner" for entering and leaving. Odd-degree nodes always have one "wallflower" bridge that can only be used at the very beginning or end.
:::

Based on this elegant reasoning, Euler arrived at his famous theorem:

::: {.callout-note title="Euler's Path Theorem"}
A walk that crosses all edges exactly once exists **if and only if**:

1. **The graph is connected** (you can reach any node from any other node), **AND**
2. **Either:**
   - All nodes have even degree (forms an Euler circuit), **OR**
   - Exactly two nodes have odd degree (forms an Euler path)

:::

This wasn't just a solution‚Äîit was a **proof**. Euler had shown not just whether such a path exists, but exactly when it's possible.

## ‚öñÔ∏è The Verdict: K√∂nigsberg's Impossible Dream

Applying Euler's theorem to the original K√∂nigsberg bridges reveals the truth: **every landmass has an odd number of bridges**. According to Euler's conditions, this makes the desired walk impossible.

::: {.column-margin}
In the original graph: North shore (3 bridges), South shore (3 bridges), Large island (5 bridges), Small island (3 bridges). Four nodes with odd degree‚Äîexactly two more than Euler's theorem allows.
:::

The citizens of K√∂nigsberg had been attempting the impossible. Their Sunday stroll puzzle had no solution, and Euler had proven it with mathematical certainty.

The story takes a sobering turn during World War II. In 1944, K√∂nigsberg was heavily bombed by Allied forces, and later captured by the Soviet Union. Two of the seven historic bridges were destroyed in the bombardment.

![](../figs/seven-bridge-bombared.png){#fig-markdown-fig fig-alt="Two bridges were bombed by Soviet Union, which allows the Euler path to exist."}

: After WWII bombing, only five bridges remained‚Äîfinally making an Euler path possible. {#fig-markdown-fig}

::: {.column-margin}
The city was renamed Kaliningrad and became part of Russia. Today, it remains a Russian exclave, separated from the rest of Russia by Lithuania and Poland. The few remaining bridges span a river now in a very different political landscape.
:::

With only five bridges remaining, the network finally satisfied Euler's conditions: exactly two nodes had odd degree. The mathematical puzzle that had stumped citizens for two centuries was "solved" by the tragic circumstances of war.

This ironic resolution reminds us that while mathematics reveals timeless truths about structure and possibility, the physical world‚Äîand human history‚Äîfollows much more complex and unpredictable patterns.

## The Lasting Legacy

Euler's solution to the K√∂nigsberg bridge problem did far more than solve a recreational puzzle. It demonstrated that:

- **Abstract thinking** can solve concrete problems
- **Mathematical proof** is more powerful than trial and error
- **Network structure** determines what's possible in interconnected systems

These insights now underpin our understanding of everything from internet routing protocols to epidemic spreading models. Every time you use GPS navigation or analyze social network data, you're applying principles that trace back to Euler's Sunday stroll through K√∂nigsberg.

### Fun trivia:

**[Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)** (1707-1783): Swiss mathematician and physicist, widely regarded as one of the most prolific mathematicians in history. Beyond solving the K√∂nigsberg bridge problem, he made fundamental contributions to calculus, topology, number theory, and physics. Despite losing sight in one eye and later becoming completely blind, he continued his mathematical work and produced nearly half of his total output after losing his sight.

**[Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant)** (1724-1804): German philosopher and one of the central thinkers of the Enlightenment. Born and died in K√∂nigsberg, never traveling more than 10 miles from the city. His systematic works in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics have made him one of the most influential figures in modern Western philosophy. His regular daily walks were so punctual that neighbors reportedly set their clocks by his daily walks.
