# Module 9: Graph Neural Networks

## What to learn in this module

In this module, we will learn how to use neural networks to learn representations of graphs. We will learn:
- Fourier transform on image
- Fourier transform on graph
- Spectral filters
- Graph convolutional networks
- Popular GNNs (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, and GIN)
