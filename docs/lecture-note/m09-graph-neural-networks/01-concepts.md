# Concepts: Graph Neural Networks

## What to learn in this module

In this module, we will learn how to use neural networks to learn representations of graphs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) extend the power of deep learning to graph-structured data, bridging concepts from signal processing, spectral graph theory, and modern neural architectures.

We will cover:
- Fourier transform on images and its extension to graphs
- Spectral filters and their role in graph signal processing
- Graph convolutional networks and the message passing framework
- Popular GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, and GIN
- Practical applications and implementation considerations

## From Images to Graphs: Extending Convolution

Graph Neural Networks build on the fundamental concepts of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in image processing. While CNNs excel at processing regular grid structures like images, GNNs extend these concepts to irregular graph structures found in social networks, molecular data, and knowledge graphs.

The key insight is that both image processing and graph analysis involve aggregating information from local neighborhoods. In images, this neighborhood is defined by spatial proximity (adjacent pixels), while in graphs, it's defined by edge connections between nodes.

## Mathematical Foundations

Understanding GNNs requires familiarity with several mathematical concepts that bridge signal processing and graph theory. The spectral approach to graph analysis provides a principled way to define operations like convolution on irregular structures.

Key mathematical foundations include:
- **Spectral Graph Theory**: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of graph matrices provide the frequency domain representation
- **Fourier Analysis on Graphs**: Extending classical signal processing concepts to graph domains  
- **Message Passing Framework**: A unified view of how information flows through graph structures
- **Learnable Aggregation**: Neural network approaches to combining neighborhood information
