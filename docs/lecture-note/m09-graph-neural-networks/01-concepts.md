# Concepts: Graph Neural Networks

## What to learn in this module

In this module, we will learn how to use neural networks to learn representations of graphs. We will learn:
- Fourier transform on image
- Fourier transform on graph
- Spectral filters
- Graph convolutional networks
- Popular GNNs (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, and GIN)

## Theoretical Exercises

### Pen and paper exercises

- [✍️ Pen and paper exercises](pen-and-paper/exercise.pdf)

The pen and paper exercises will help you understand the mathematical foundations of graph neural networks, including:

1. **Spectral Graph Theory**: Understanding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of graph matrices
2. **Fourier Analysis on Graphs**: Extending classical signal processing to graph domains
3. **Convolution Operations**: Defining convolution for irregular graph structures
4. **Message Passing**: Mathematical formulation of information aggregation in graphs
5. **Network Architecture Design**: Principles for designing effective GNN architectures

These exercises provide the theoretical foundation necessary to understand how graph neural networks process and learn from graph-structured data.
