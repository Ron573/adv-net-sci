# Module 7: Random Walks

## What to learn in this module

In this module, we will learn random walks, one of the most fundamental techniques in network analysis. We will learn:
- What is a random walk?
- How to simulate a random walk on a network?
- What is the behavior of a random walk on a network?
- Implicit connections to community detection and network centralities
- **Keywords**: random walk, community detection, network centralities
