We will learn:\n\n- What is community structure in networks?\n- How to operationalize community structure?\n- How to find communities in networks?\n- Limitations of community detection\n- **Keywords**: community detection, assortativity, modularity, resolution limit, rugged landscape, random graph, label switching algorithm, Louvain algorithm, stochastic block model, the configuration model.\n\n\n### Pen and Paper Exercise\n\n‚úçÔ∏è [Pen and Paper Exercise](./pen-and-paper/exercise.pdf) üö¢\n\n## What is community structure?\n\nBirds of a feather flock together, and so do many other things. For instance, we have a group of friends with similar interests who hang out together frequently but may not interact as much with other groups.\n\n![Birds of a feather](https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/08/10/89/17/360_F_810891701_xy4NsqgdqllMfKDfV6V27ycrw8FLFqrw.jpg)\n\nIn networks, communities are groups of nodes that share similar connection patterns. These communities do not always mean densely-connected nodes. Sometimes, a community can be nodes that are not connected to each other, but connect similarly to other groups. For instance, in a user-movie rating network, a community might be users with similar movie tastes, even if they don't directly connect to each other.\n\n![Community structure in a social network](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Network_Community_Structure.svg/220px-Network_Community_Structure.svg.png)\n\nCommunities reflect underlying mechanisms of network formation and underpin the dynamics of information propagation. Examples include:\n\n1. Homophily: The tendency of similar nodes to form connections.\n2. Functional groups: Nodes that collaborate for specific purposes.\n3. Hierarchical structure: Smaller communities existing within larger ones.\n4. Information flow: The patterns of information, influence, or disease propagation through the network.\n\nThis is why network scientists are sooo obsessed with community structure in networks. See [@fortunato2010community], [@fortunato2016community], [@peixoto2019bayesian] for comprehensive reviews on network communities.\n\n## Pattern matching approach\n\nCommunity detection is an abstract unsupervised problem. It is abstract because there is no clear-cut definition or ground truth to compare against. The concept of a community in a network is subjective and highly context-dependent.\n\nA classical approach to community detection is based on *pattern matching*. Namely, we first explicitly define a community by a specific connectivity pattern of its members. Then, we search for these communities in the network.\n\n::: {#fig-clique}\n\n<img src=\"https://pythonhosted.org/trustedanalytics/R_images/k-clique_201508281155.png\" alt=\"Clique graph\" width=\"80%\">\n\nCliques of different sizes. Taken from [https://pythonhosted.org/trustedanalytics/python_api/graphs/graph-/kclique_percolation.html](https://pythonhosted.org/trustedanalytics/python_api/graphs/graph-/kclique_percolation.html)\n:::\n\nPerhaps, the strictest definition of a community is a *clique*: a group of nodes all connected to each other. Examples include triangles (3-node cliques) and fully-connected squares (4-node cliques). However, cliques are often too rigid for real-world networks. In social networks, for instance, large groups of friends rarely have every member connected to every other, yet we want to accept such \"in-perfect\" social circles as communities. This leads to the idea of relaxed versions of cliques, called **pseudo-cliques**.\n\nPseudo-cliques are defined by relaxing at least one of the following three dimensions of strictness, i.e., degree, density, and distance. We will walk through each of them in details as follows.\n\n### Degree relaxation\n\nDegree relaxation acknowledges that real-world groups rarely have perfect connectivity among all members. The *k-plex* [@seidman1978graph] is a classic example: it allows each node in a group to miss connections to up to $k$ other members, making it possible to model social circles where not everyone knows everyone else.\n\nA similar relaxation is the **k-core** [@seidman1983network], which requires each node to have at least $k$ connections within the group, capturing the idea of a \"core\" of well-connected individuals. These approaches reflect the reality that cohesive groups can exist even when some connections are missing, and they help distinguish between core and peripheral members in a network.\n\n::: {#fig-k-plex}\n```{dot}\n//| fig-width: 6\n//| fig-height: 3\n//| fig-align: center\n\ngraph G {\n    layout=fdp;\n    node [shape=circle, style=filled, fontsize=20, width=0.6];\n    edge [len=1.5];\n\n    // œÅ-dense: qualifies (has 8/10 = 80% > 75% threshold)\n    subgraph cluster_dense {\n        label=\" 2-plex, 2-core\";\n        #style=filled;\n        #fillcolor=\"#e8f5e8\";\n        fontsize=20;\n        peripheries=0;\n\n        a [pos=\"0.5,2.5!\", fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n        b [pos=\"1.5,3!\", fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n        c [pos=\"2,2!\", fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n        d [pos=\"1.5,1!\", fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n        e [pos=\"0.5,1.5!\", fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n\n        a -- b; a -- e;\n        b -- c; b -- e;\n        c -- d; c -- e;\n        d -- e;\n        // Missing: a -- c, b -- d (has 8 out of 10 possible edges = 80%)\n    }\n\n    // Not œÅ-dense: fails (has 4/10 = 40% < 75% threshold)\n    subgraph cluster_not_dense {\n        label=\"3-plex, 1-core\";\n        #style=filled;\n        #fillcolor=\"#ffe8e8\";\n        fontsize=20;\n        peripheries=0;\n\n        f [pos=\"5.5,2.5!\", fillcolor=\"#ff9999\"];\n        g [pos=\"6.5,3!\", fillcolor=\"#ff9999\"];\n        h [pos=\"7,2!\", fillcolor=\"#ff9999\"];\n        i [pos=\"6.5,1!\", fillcolor=\"#ff9999\"];\n        j [pos=\"5.5,1.5!\", fillcolor=\"#ff9999\"];\n\n        f -- g;\n        g -- h;\n        i -- j;\n        j -- f;\n        // Missing 6 edges: has only 4 out of 10 possible edges = 40%\n    }\n}\n```\n\nComparison of the k-plex and k-core in different graphs.\n\n:::\n\n### Density relaxation\n\nDensity relaxation shifts the focus from individual connections to the overall cohesiveness of the group. Instead of requiring every possible connection, a **$\\rho$-dense subgraph** [@goldberg1984finding] enforces that the group contains at least a fraction $\\rho$ of all possible internal edges. This approach is useful for identifying communities that are highly, but not perfectly, interconnected‚Äîsuch as a friend group where most, but not all, pairs know each other.\n\n::: {#fig-density-relaxation}\n```{dot}\n//| fig-width: 6\n//| fig-height: 3\n//| fig-align: center\n\ngraph G {\n    layout=fdp;\n    node [shape=circle, style=filled, fontsize=20, width=0.6];\n    edge [len=1.5];\n\n    // œÅ-dense: qualifies (has 8/10 = 80% > 75% threshold)\n    subgraph cluster_dense {\n        label=\"0.7-dense, 2-plex, 2-core\";\n        #style=filled;\n        #fillcolor=\"#e8f5e8\";\n        fontsize=20;\n        peripheries=0;\n\n        a [pos=\"0.5,2.5!\", fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n        b [pos=\"1.5,3!\", fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n        c [pos=\"2,2!\", fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n        d [pos=\"1.5,1!\", fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n        e [pos=\"0.5,1.5!\", fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n\n        a -- b; a -- e;\n        b -- c; b -- e;\n        c -- d; c -- e;\n        d -- e;\n        // Missing: a -- c, b -- d (has 8 out of 10 possible edges = 80%)\n    }\n\n    // Not œÅ-dense: fails (has 4/10 = 40% < 75% threshold)\n    subgraph cluster_not_dense {\n        label=\"0.7-dense, 3-plex, 1-core\";\n        #style=filled;\n        #fillcolor=\"#ffe8e8\";\n        fontsize=20;\n        peripheries=0;\n\n        f [pos=\"5.5,2.5!\", fillcolor=\"#ff9999\"];\n        g [pos=\"6.5,3!\", fillcolor=\"#ff9999\"];\n        h [pos=\"7,2!\", fillcolor=\"#ff9999\"];\n        i [pos=\"6.5,1!\", fillcolor=\"#ff9999\"];\n        j [pos=\"5.5,1.5!\", fillcolor=\"#ff9999\"];\n\n        f -- g;\n        g -- h;\n        i -- j;\n        j -- f;\n        f -- h;\n        j -- h;\n        j -- g;\n\n        // Missing 6 edges: has only 4 out of 10 possible edges = 40%\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe two subgraphs are equally dense, but the left one is 2-plex and 2-core, while the right one is 3-plex and 1-core.\n\n:::\n\n### Distance relaxation\nDistance relaxation allows for the inclusion of nodes that are not directly connected but are still close in terms of network steps. The **$n$-clique** [@luce1950connectivity] is a group where every pair of nodes is within $n$ steps of each other, so members can be connected through mutual friends. However, this can sometimes include connections that pass through nodes outside the group, which led to refinements such as the **$n$-clan** and **$n$-club** [@mokken1979cliques], where all paths between members must remain within the group itself. These definitions help capture the idea of communities that are tightly knit not just by direct ties, but also by short, internal paths.\n\n::: {#fig-distance-relaxation}\n```{dot}\n//| fig-width: 6\n//| fig-height: 3\n//| fig-align: center\ngraph G {\n    layout=fdp;\n    node [shape=circle, style=filled, fontsize=20, width=0.4, fillcolor=black];\n    edge [len=1.2];\n\n    // 2-Clique (larger dashed box)\n    subgraph cluster_clique {\n        style=dashed;\n        fontsize=16;\n        peripheries=0;\n\n        // 2-Clan (inner solid box)\n        subgraph cluster_clan {\n            label=\"3-clan, 2-clique\";\n            style=dashed;\n            fontsize=20;\n            peripheries=1;\n\n            // Inner square/rectangle of 4 nodes\n            a [pos=\"2,2!\" fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n            b [pos=\"4,2!\" fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n            c [pos=\"4,0.5!\" fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n            d [pos=\"2,0.5!\" fillcolor=\"#45b7d1\"];\n\n            // Square connections\n            a -- b;\n            c -- d;\n            d -- a;\n\n        }\n\n        // Two external nodes connected to the clan\n        e [pos=\"0.5,1.25!\" fillcolor=\"#afafaf\"];\n        f [pos=\"5.5,1.25!\" fillcolor=\"#afafaf\"];\n\n        // External connections\n        e -- a;\n        e -- d;\n        f -- b;\n        f -- c;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn both n-clique and n-clan, two nodes are connected at most $n$ steps apart. But for the n-clique, they can be connected through other nodes outside the group. n-clan is more strict in a sense that it requires all paths between two nodes to be within the group.\n\n:::\n\n### Hybrid approaches\nHybrid approaches combine these dimensions to capture even more nuanced community structures. The **$k$-truss** [@saito2008extracting; @cohen2009graph; @wang2010triangulation] requires that every edge in the group participates in at least $k-2$ triangles, emphasizing the importance of triadic relationships for group stability. The **$\\rho$-dense core** [@koujaku2016dense] balances high internal density with sparse external connections, identifying groups that are not only cohesive inside but also well-separated from the rest of the network. These hybrid definitions reflect the complex and overlapping nature of real-world communities, where both internal cohesion and clear boundaries matter.\n\n::: {#fig-clique-pattern}\n\n<img src=\"https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0378873315000520-gr1.jpg\" alt=\"Pseudo-clique patterns\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n\nIllustation of different pseudo cliques. Taken from {footcite}`koujaku2016dense`.\n\n:::\n\n\n## Graph cut approach\n\nAnother approach from computer science is to treat a community detection problem as an *optimization* problem. An early example is the **graph cut** problem, which asks to find the minimum number of edges to cut the graph into two disconnected components.\n\nSpecifically, let us consider cutting the network into two communities. Let $V_1$ and $V_2$ be the set of nodes in the two communities. Then, the cut is the number of edges between the two communities, which is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Cut}(V_1, V_2) = \\sum_{i \\in V_1} \\sum_{j \\in V_2} A_{ij}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nNow, the community detection problem is translated into **an optimization problem**, with the goal of finding a cut $V_1, V_2$ that minimizes $\\text{Cut}(V_1, V_2)$.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise\"}\n\nThe description of this problem is not complete üòà.\n\nCan you identify what is missing in the description of the graph cut problem? Without this, the best cut is trivial. \"<a href='https://skojaku.github.io/adv-net-sci/assets/vis/community-detection/index.html?scoreType=graphcut&numCommunities=2&randomness=1&dataFile=two-cliques.json'>Graph Cut Problem üéÆ</a>\"\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" title=\"Click to reveal the answer!\" appearance=\"simple\"}\nThe missing element is a constraint: each community must contain at least one node. Without this, the trivial solution of placing all nodes in a single community would always yield a cut of zero.\n:::\n\n### Balanced cut\n\nGraph cut often provide unbalanced communities, e.g., a community consisting of a single node, and another consisting of all other nodes. For example, if the network has a node with degree one (e.g., one edge), an optimal cut will be to place this node in its own community, resulting in a cut of one.\n\n\n#### Ratio cut\n\n**Ratio cut** addresses this issue by introducing a normalization factor to balance the cut.\nSuppose we cut the network into two communities $V_1$ and $V_2$, then the ratio cut is defined as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Ratio cut}(V_1, V_2) = \\frac{1}{|V_1| \\cdot |V_2|} \\sum_{i \\in V_1} \\sum_{j \\in V_2} A_{ij}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nThe normalization factor $1/(|V_1| |V_2|)$ balances the community sizes. It's smallest when communities are equal ($|V_1| = |V_2|$) and largest when one community has only one node ($|V_1| = 1$ or $|V_2| = 1$).\n\n#### Normalized cut\n\n**Normalized cut** [@shi2000normalized] balances communities based on edge count, unlike Ratio cut which uses node count. It is defined as\n\n\n$$\n\\text{Normalized cut}(V_1, V_2) = \\frac{1}{|E_1| \\cdot |E_2|} \\sum_{i \\in V_1} \\sum_{j \\in V_2} A_{ij}\n$$\n\n- $|E_1|$ and $|E_2|$ are the number of edges in the communities $V_1$ and $V_2$, respectively.\n\n\n#### Cut into more than two communities\n\nRatio cut and Normalized cut can be extended to cut into more than two communities. Specifically, we can extend them to cut into $k$ communities, i.e., $V_1, V_2, \\dots, V_k$ by defining\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Ratio cut}(V_1, V_2, \\dots, V_k) &= \\sum_{k=1}^K \\frac{1}{|V_k|} \\left(\\sum_{i \\in V_k} \\sum_{j \\notin V_{k}} A_{ij} \\right) \\\\\n\\text{Normalized cut}(V_1, V_2, \\dots, V_k) &= \\sum_{k=1}^K \\frac{1}{|E_k|} \\left(\\sum_{i \\in V_k} \\sum_{j \\notin V_{k}} A_{ij} \\right)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n\nFor both ratio and normalized cut, finding the best cut is a NP-hard problem. Yet, there are some heuristics to find a good cut.\nInterested students are encouraged to refer to [Ulrike von Luxburg \"A Tutorial on Spectral Clustering\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0189) for more details.\n\n:::\n\nA key limitation of Ratio cut and Normalized cut is that they require us to choose the number of communities in advance, which is often unknown in real networks. This leads to the most celebrated yet controversial community detection method, i.e, **modularity maximization**, which we will cover in the next section.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise\"}\n\nAnother key limitation of Ratio cut and Normalized cut is that they tend to favor communities of similar size, even though real communities can vary a lot [@palla2005uncovering;@clauset2004finding]. This problem also exists in the modularity maximization method.\n\n:::\n\n\n## Modularity: measuring assortativity against null models\n\n\n### Key idea\n\n**Modularity** is by far the most widely used method for community detection. Modularity can be derived in many ways, but we will follow the one derived from assortativity.\n\n**Assortativity** is a measure of the tendency of nodes to connect with nodes of the same attribute. The attribute, in our case, is the community that the node belongs to, and we say that a network is assortative if nodes of the same community are more likely to connect with each other than nodes of different communities.\n\nLet's think about assortativity by using color balls and strings! üé®üßµ\n\n::: {#fig-fig-modularity-game}\n\n<img src=\"../figs/modularity.jpg\" alt=\"Single node failure\" width=\"100%\">\n\nIllustration of how modularity measures assortativity relative to a null model.\n:::\n\nImagine we're playing a game as follows:\n\n1. Picture each connection in our network as two colored balls joined by a piece of string. üî¥üü¢--üîµüü°\n2. The color of each ball shows which community it belongs to.\n3. Now, let's toss all these ball-and-string pairs into a big bag.\n4. We'll keep pulling out strings with replacement and checking if the balls on each end match colors.\n\nThe more color matches we find, the more assortative our network is. But, there's a catch! What if we got lots of matches just by luck? For example, if all our balls were the same color, we'd always get a match. But that doesn't tell us much about our communities. So, to be extra clever, we compare our results to a \"random\" version (null model):\n\n1. We snip all the strings and mix up all the balls.\n2. Then we draw pairs of balls at random *with replacement* and see how often the colors match.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\nBy comparing our original network to this mixed-up version, we can see if our communities are really sticking together more than we'd expect by chance.\nFor example, if all nodes belong to the same community, we would always get a match for the random version as well, which informs us that a high likelihood of matches is not surprising.\n:::\n\nBuilding on this, the modularity is defined as\n\n$$\n\\dfrac{\\text{\\# of matches} - \\text{Average \\# of random matches}}{\\text{Maximum possible \\# of matches}}\n$$\n\nThis comparison against the random version is the heart of modularity. Unlike graph cut methods that aim to maximize assortativity directly, modularity measures assortativity *relative* to *a null model*.\n\n### Modularity formula\n\nLet's dive into the modularity formula! To put modularity into math terms, we need a few ingredients:\n\n- $m$: The total number of strings (edges) in our bag\n- $n$: The total number of balls (nodes) we have\n- $A_{ij}$: This tells us if ball $i$ and ball $j$ are connected by a string\n- $\\delta(c_i,c_j)$: This is our color-checker. It gives us a 1 if balls $i$ and $j$ are the same color (same community), and 0 if they're different.\n\nNow, the probability of pulling out a string out of $m$ string and finding matching colors on both ends is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=i+1}^n A_{ij} \\delta(c_i,c_j) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij} \\delta(c_i,c_j)\n$$\n\nWe set $A_{ii} = 0$ by assuming our network doesn't have any \"selfie strings\" (where a ball is connected to itself). Also, we changed our edge counting a bit. Instead of counting each string once (which gave us $m$), we're now counting each string twice (once from each end). That's why we use $2m$ on the right-hand side of the equation.\n\nNow, imagine we've cut all the strings, and we're going to draw two balls at random with replacement.\nHere's how our new bag looks:\n\n- We have $2m$ balls in total ($1$ string has $2$ balls, and thus $m$ strings have $2m$ balls in total).\n- A node with $k$ edges correspond to the $k$ of $2m$ balls in the bag.\n- The color of each ball in our bag matches the color (or community) of its node in the network.\n\nNow, what's the chance of pulling out two balls of the same color?\n\n$$\n\\sum_{c=1}^C \\left( \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i \\delta(c, c_i) \\right)^2\n$$\n\nwhere $k_i$ is the degree (i.e., the number of edges) of node $i$, and $C$ is the total number of communities (i.e., colors).\n\nHere's what it means in simple terms:\n\n- We look at each color ($c$) one by one (the outer sum).\n- For each color, we figure out how many balls of that color are in our bag ($\\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i \\delta(c, c_i)$).\n- We divide by $2m$ to get the probability of drawing a ball of that color.\n- We then calculate the chance of grabbing that color twice in a row ($\\left( \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i \\delta(c, c_i) \\right)^2$).\n- Finally, we add up these chances for all $C$ colors.\n\nPutting altogether, the modularity is defined by\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nQ &=\\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij} \\delta(c_i,c_j) - \\sum_{c=1}^C \\left( \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i \\delta(c, c_i) \\right)^2\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nBy rearranging the terms, we get the standard expression for modularity:\n\n$$\nQ =\\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left[ A_{ij} -  \\frac{k_ik_j}{2m} \\right]\\delta(c_i,c_j)\n$$\n\nSee the Appendix for the derivations.\n\n### Modularity Demo\n\nLet's learn how the modularity works by playing with a community detection game!\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise 1\"}\n\nFind communities by maximizing the modularity.

[Modularity maximization (four communities) üéÆ](https://skojaku.github.io/adv-net-sci/assets/vis/community-detection/index.html?scoreType=modularity&numCommunities=3&randomness=0.9&dataFile=two-cliques-big-clique.json)\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"true\" title=\"Click here to see the solution\"}\n\nThe best modularity score actually comes from merging our two cliques into one big community. This behavior is what we call the **Resolution limit** [@fortunato2007resolution]. Modularity can't quite make out communities that are smaller than a certain size!\n\nThink of it like this: modularity is trying to see the big picture, but it misses the little details. In network terms, the number of edges $m_c$ in a community $c$ has to be bigger than a certain size. This size is related to the total number of edges $m$ in the whole network. We write this mathematically as ${\\cal O}(m)$.\n\n:::\n\n\n### Spurious communities\n\nWhat if the network does not have any communities at all? Does the modularity find no communities? To find out, let's run the modularity on a random network, where each pair of nodes is connected randomly with the same probability.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise 5\"}\n:class: tip\n\nFind communities by maximizing the modularity.

It's like finding shapes in clouds - sometimes our brains (or algorithms) see patterns where there aren't any.\n\nThe wild thing is that the modularity score for this random network is even higher than what we saw for our network with two clear cliques!\n\nThis teaches us two important lessons:\n1. We can't compare modularity scores between different networks. It's like comparing apples and oranges! üçéüçä\n2. A high modularity score doesn't always mean we've found communities.\n\nInterested readers can read more about this in [this tweet by Tiago Peixoto](https://twitter.com/tiagopeixoto/status/1466352013856358400) and the discussion [here](https://reticular.hypotheses.org/1924).\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" style=\"max-width: 550px;\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Modularity maximization is not a reliable method to find communities in networks.

Modularity is still a powerful tool for finding communities in networks. Like any other method, it has its limitations. And knowing these limitations is crucial for using it effectively. There is \"free lunch\" in community detection [@peel2017ground].\nWhen these implicit assumptions are met, modularity is in fact a very powerful method for community detection. For example, it is in fact an \"optimal\" method for a certain class of networks [@nadakuditi2012graph].\n\n## Stochastic Block Model\n\nLet's talk about two ways to look at communities in networks. In modularity maximization, we are given a network and asked to find the best way to group its parts into communities.\nLet's flip that idea on its head! üôÉ Instead of starting with a network and looking for communities, we start with the communities and ask, *\"What kind of network would we get if the nodes form these communities?\"*. This is the idea of the **Stochastic Block Model (SBM)**.\n\n### Model\n\nIn stochastic block model, we describe a network using probabilities given a community structure. Specifically, let us consider two nodes $i$ and $j$ who belong to community $c_i$ and $c_j$. Then, the probability of an edge between $i$ and $j$ is given by their community membership.\n\n$$\nP(A_{ij}=1|c_i, c_j) = p_{c_i,c_j}\n$$\n\nwhere $p_{c_i,c_j}$ is the probability of an edge between nodes in community $c_i$ and $c_j$, respectively.\nImportantly, the probability $p_{c_i,c_j}$ is specified by the community membership of the nodes, $c_i$ and $c_j$.\nAs a result, when plotting the adjacency matrix of one realization of SBM, we observe \"blocks\" of different edge densities, which is why we say that SBM is a \"block model\".\n\n::: {#cell-fig-sbm-adjacency-matrix .cell fig-height='4' fig-width='6' execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Adjacency Matrix of Stochastic Block Model](01-concepts_files/figure-html/fig-sbm-adjacency-matrix-output-1.png){#fig-sbm-adjacency-matrix fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Characterizing network structures with the SBM\n\nStochastic Block Model is a flexible model that can be used to describe a wide range of network structures.\n\nLet's start with communities where nodes within a community are more likely to be connected to each other than nodes in different communities. We can describe this using SBM by:\n\n$$\nP_{c,c'} = \\begin{cases}\n    p_{\\text{in}} & \\text{if } c = c' \\\\\n    p_{\\text{out}} & \\text{if } c \\neq c'\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n-  $p_{\\text{in}}$ is the chance of a connection between nodes in the same community\n- $p_{\\text{out}}$ is the chance of a connection between nodes in different communities\n\nUsually, we set $p_{\\text{in}} > p_{\\text{out}}$, because nodes in the same community tend to be more connected.\n\nBut, there's more SBM can do:\n\n1. **Disassortative communities**: What if we flip things around and set $p_{\\text{in}} < p_{\\text{out}}$? Now we have communities where nodes prefer to connect with nodes from other communities. This is not in line with the communities we have focused on so far. Yet, it is still a valid model of community structure, and SBM allows for this generalization of community structure easily.\n\n2. **Random networks**: If we make $p_{\\text{in}} = p_{\\text{out}}$, we get a completely random network where every node has an equal chance of connecting to any other node. This is what we call an Erd≈ës-R√©nyi network.\n\nIn sum, SBM has been used as a playground for network scientists. We can use it to create many interesting network structures and study how they behave.\n\n### Detecting communities with SBM\n\nIf we know how a network is generated given a community membership, then we can ask ourselves the following question: what is the most likely community membership that generates the observed network? This is exactly a maximum likelihood problem.\n\nWe can describe the probability of seeing a particular network, given a community structure as follows:\n\n$$\nP(\\left\\{A_{ij}\\right\\}_{ij}) = \\prod_{i<j} P(A_{ij}=1|c_i, c_j)^{A_{ij}} (1-P(A_{ij}=1|c_i, c_j))^{1-A_{ij}}.\n$$\n\nLet's break this down into simpler terms:\n\n- First, $\\left\\{A_{ij}\\right\\}_{ij}$ is just saying \"all the connections in our network\". Think of it as a big table showing who's connected to whom.\n\n- We use $\\prod_{i < j}$ instead of $\\prod_{i,j}$ because we're dealing with an undirected network. This means if Alice is friends with Bob, Bob is also friends with Alice. We only need to count this friendship once, not twice.\n\n- The last part, $P(A_{ij}=1|c_i, c_j)^A_{ij}(1-P(A_{ij}=1|c_i, c_j))^{1-A_{ij}}$ is a shorthand way of saying \"what's the chance of this connection existing or not existing?\" If the connection exists ($A_{ij}=1$), we use the first part. If it doesn't ($A_{ij}=0$), we use the second part. It's a two-in-one formula.\n\nWe can take the logarithm of both sides of our equation. This turns our big product (multiplication) into a simpler sum (addition).\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\cal L}=&\\log P(\\left\\{A_{ij}\\right\\}_{ij}) \\\\\n=& \\sum_{i<j} A_{ij} \\log P(A_{ij}=1|c_i, c_j) \\\\\n&+ (1-A_{ij}) \\log (1-P(A_{ij}=1|c_i, c_j)).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe call this the **likelihood function**. It tells us how likely we are to see this network given our community guess. We can play around with different community assignments and edge probabilities to see which one gives us the highest likelihood.\n\nOur likelihood function has a special shape - it is a concave function with respect to $p_{c,c'}$. This means that the likelihood function is a hill with only one peak when we look at it in terms of edge probability $p_{c,c'}$.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-likelihood-function .cell fig-height='4' fig-width='6' execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Schematic of Likelihood Function (Concave)](01-concepts_files/figure-html/fig-likelihood-function-output-1.png){#fig-likelihood-function fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo, what does this mean for us? The top of this hill (our maximum value) is flat, and there's only one flat spot on the whole hill. So if we can find a spot where the hill isn't sloping at all (that's what we mean by \"zero gradient\"), we've found the very top of the hill.;\n\nIn math terms, we take the derivative of our likelihood function with respect to $p_{c,c'}$ and set it to zero, i.e., $\\partial {\\cal L}  / \\partial p_{cc'} = 0$. Here is what we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial {\\cal L}}{\\partial p_{c,c'}} &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & \\sum_{i<j} \\left[A_{ij} \\frac{1}{p_{c_i,c_j}} \\delta(c_i,c)\\delta(c_j,c') -(1-A_{ij}) \\frac{1}{1-p_{c_i,c_j}}\\delta(c_i,c')\\delta(c_j,c') \\right] = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow &\n\\frac{m_{cc'}}{p_{c_i,c_j}} - \\frac{\\sum_{i < j} \\delta(c_i,c)\\delta(c_j,c') }{1-p_{c_i,c_j}} = 0 & \\text{if } c \\neq  c' \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & p_{c,c'} = \\frac{m_{cc'}}{\\sum_{i < j} \\delta(c_i,c)\\delta(c_j,c')}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLet's break down these equations:\n\n- $m_{cc'}$ is the number of edges between nodes in community $c$ and those in community $c'$.\n- The derivative $\\partial \\log p_{cc} / \\partial p_{cc}$ is just $1/p_{cc}$.\n\nThe denominator $\\sum_{i < j} \\delta(c_i,c)\\delta(c_j,c')$ is the total number of pairs of nodes that belong to communities $c$ and $c'$. It is given by\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i < j} \\delta(c_i,c)\\delta(c_j,c') =\n\\begin{cases}\nn_cn_{c'} & \\text{if } c \\neq c' \\\\\n\\frac{n_c (n_c - 1)}{2} & \\text{if } c = c'\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWhy do we have two different equations for $p_{c,c'}$? It's because we are counting each pair of nodes only by once. It is easy to verify when looking at the adjacency matrix:\n\n::: {#cell-fig-adjacency-matrix .cell fig-height='4' fig-width='6' execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Adjacency Matrix of Stochastic Block Model](01-concepts_files/figure-html/fig-adjacency-matrix-output-1.png){#fig-adjacency-matrix fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe upper triangle of the adjacency matrix represents $i < j$ over which we take the sum.\nWhen $c=c'$ (the diagonal block), we count only the upper half of the block, resulting in $\\frac{n_c (n_c - 1)}{2}$. When $c \\neq c'$ (different communities), we count all connections between them, resulting in $n_cn_{c'}$.\n\nWe have now obtaind the likelihood function based only on the community assignment. Maximizing ${\\cal L}$ with respect to the community assignment gives us the most likely community assignment for the network.\n\n```{bibliography}\n```\n\n",
