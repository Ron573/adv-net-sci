Feeeeeel'' is a famous quote by Bruce Lee in the movie *Enter the Dragon*, and this is my guiding philosophy of learning.\n\nThis course is designed to help you *feel* the concepts and tools of network science through pen-and-paper exercises and hands-on coding.\n\n## List of Exercises\n\n| Module | Pen and Paper Exercise | Jupyter Notebook |\n|--------|------------------------|------------------|\n| M01: Euler Tour | [The Koningsberg Bridge](http://estebanmoro.org/pdf/netsci_for_kids/the_konisberg_bridges.pdf) | [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/skojaku/adv-net-sci/tree/main/notebooks/exercise-m01-euler-tour.ipynb) |\n| M02: Small World | [Itâ€™s a small world!! 6 degrees of separation](http://estebanmoro.org/pdf/netsci_for_kids/6_degrees_of_separation.pdf) | [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/skojaku/adv-net-sci/tree/main/notebooks/exercise-m02-small-world.ipynb) |\n| M03: Robustness | [Build it, Break it, and Build it back!](m03-robustness/pen-and-paper/exercise.pdf) | [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/skojaku/adv-net-sci/tree/main/notebooks/exercise-m03-robustness.ipynb) |\n| M04: Friendship Paradox | [Data Visualization](m04-friendship-paradox/pen-and-paper/exercise.pdf) | [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/skojaku/adv-net-sci/tree/main/notebooks/exercise-m04-friendship-paradox.ipynb) |\n| M05: Clustering | [Perfect vs. Almost Perfect](m05-clustering/pen-and-paper/exercise.pdf) | [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/skojaku/adv-net-sci/tree/main/notebooks/exercise-m05-clustering.ipynb) |\n| M06: Centrality | [Who's the Big Cheese in the University Clubs?](m06-centrality/pen-and-paper/exercise.pdf) | [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/skojaku/adv-net-sci/tree/main/notebooks/exercise-m06-centrality.ipynb) |\n| M07: Random Walks | [Random Walks on Networks](m07-random-walks/pen-and-paper/exercise.pdf) | [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/skojaku/adv-net-sci/tree/main/notebooks/exercise-m07-random-walks.ipynb) |\n| M08: Embedding | [Network Embeddings](m08-embedding/pen-and-paper/exercise.pdf) | [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/skojaku/adv-net-sci/tree/main/notebooks/exercise-m08-embedding.ipynb) |\n| M09: Graph Neural Networks | [Graph Neural Networks](m09-graph-neural-networks/pen-and-paper/exercise.pdf) | [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/skojaku/adv-net-sci/tree/main/notebooks/exercise-m09-graph-neural-net.ipynb) |\n\n## List of assignments\n\n**Note:** For the students taking SSIE 641, the grading will be done through [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), and the following assignments are not linked to GitHub Classroom.
