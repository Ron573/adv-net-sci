# In-class experiment

"Your friends have more friends than you" is a well-known phenomenon in social networks. It appears everywhere from physical social networks to online social networks, and even random networks!
OK. Let's do not "think" but "feeeeel" this paradox through the following in-class experiment.

## Materials
- [📇 Friendship card](./friendship-cards.pdf)
- 🖊️ Pen

## Friendship Network Experiment

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

   1. [📇] Receive Your Card
      Get a card with a unique letter

   2. [🤝] Meet and Greet (5 mins)
      Move around, exchange cards with at least one friend

   3. [🧮] Count Connections (2 mins)
      Count received cards, write number, return cards

   4. [📈] Calculate Average (2 mins)
      Calculate average 'friend count' of your friends

   5. [📝] Fill Form
      Write your average and your own friend count
      in a separate sheet

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

❗ Important Notes:
