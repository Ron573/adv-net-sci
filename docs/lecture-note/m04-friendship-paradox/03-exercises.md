# M04 Exercises: Friendship Paradox

## Interactive Exercises

### 1. Friendship Paradox Game
**Objective**: Experience the friendship paradox interactively

- **üéâ Fun Challenge**: Can you create a network where your friends have the most friends? ü§îüí° Give it a try in this [Friendship Paradox Game! üéÆ‚ú®](../assets/vis/friendship-paradox-game.html)

**Questions to consider**:
- Can you create a network where the friendship paradox is absent? 
- In other words, can you create a graph where your friends have the same number of friends as you?
- What network structures minimize or maximize the friendship paradox effect?

### 2. Vaccination Game
**Objective**: Apply the friendship paradox to disease control strategies

- **üéâ Fun Challenge**: Can you control the spread of a virus by strategically vaccinating individuals? ü§îüí° Give it a try in this [Vaccination Game! üéÆ‚ú®](../assets/vis/vaccination-game.html)

**Questions to explore**:
- How does random vaccination compare to targeted vaccination?
- Why is vaccinating highly connected individuals more effective?
- What happens when vaccination resources are limited?

## Pen and Paper Exercises

**Objective**: Master the techniques for analyzing and visualizing degree distributions

üìù **Exercise**: [Plotting Degree Distribution](https://github.com/skojaku/adv-net-sci/blob/main/notebooks/exercise-m04-friendship-paradox.ipynb)

This coding exercise covers:
- Computing degree distributions
- Plotting degree distributions effectively
- Understanding complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDF)
- Comparing degree distributions of nodes vs. friends
- Mathematical proofs of the friendship paradox

**Key concepts to implement**:
1. Basic degree distribution computation
2. Log-log plotting for heavy-tailed distributions
3. CCDF calculation and visualization
4. Friend sampling and degree bias analysis
5. Mathematical verification of the friendship paradox

### 5. Extended Analysis (Optional)

**Advanced Challenge**: 
Implement the first sampling method mentioned in the coding section:
- Sample a node uniformly at random and then sample a friend of the node
- Compare this with edge-based sampling
- Analyze the differences in resulting degree distributions

**Research Questions**:
- How do different sampling methods affect the friendship paradox?
- Can you derive the mathematical relationship for node-first sampling?
- What are the practical implications of each sampling method?

## Assessment Questions

### Conceptual Understanding
1. Explain why the friendship paradox occurs in mathematical terms
