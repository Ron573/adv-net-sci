# Using Minidora: Your AI Learning Assistant




## Getting Started with Minidora

Minidora is your personal AI tutor available 24/7 through Discord to help you master network science concepts. She's designed to provide personalized learning support, answer questions about course materials, and guide you through challenging topics with patience and clarity. To interact with Minidora, simply use Discord slash commands or mention her directly in any channel or thread where she's present.

## Asking Questions and Getting Help

The most straightforward way to get help is using the `/ask` command followed by your question. For example, type `/ask What is an Euler tour?` and Minidora will provide a comprehensive explanation with examples and context from your course materials. If you're working on a specific module, you can include the module code like `/ask m01 How do I implement Hierholzer's algorithm?` to get targeted help from that particular lesson. Minidora understands the context of each module and will tailor her explanations to match the concepts you're currently studying.

## Natural Conversations and Interactive Learning

For a more conversational experience, use the `/chat` command which allows you to interact with Minidora in a natural, free-flowing manner. You can say things like `/chat I'm confused about small-world networks, can you explain them step by step?` or `/chat Can you help me debug this Python code for computing centrality?` Minidora will engage in back-and-forth dialogue, ask clarifying questions, and adapt her explanations based on your responses. This conversational approach is particularly helpful when you need to work through complex problems or want to explore topics in depth.

## Quizzes and Assessment

To test your understanding and reinforce learning, Minidora offers intelligent quiz features through the `/quiz` command. She can generate concept-based questions using `/concept-quiz m01 multiple-choice` for theoretical understanding, or coding challenges with `/code-quiz m01` to practice implementation skills. Minidora tracks your progress and adapts quiz difficulty based on your performance, focusing on areas where you need more practice. You can also request quizzes on specific topics by adding subject keywords, such as `/quiz m02 clustering algorithms`.

## Tracking Your Progress

Use the `/status` command to monitor your learning journey and see detailed insights about your progress. Minidora provides different status views: `/status summary` gives you a quick overview of questions asked and concepts mastered, while `/status concepts` shows which topics you've learned and what to study next. The `/status profile` command reveals your personalized learning profile, including your preferred difficulty level, learning style, and areas where you excel or need additional support. This helps Minidora provide increasingly personalized assistance as you continue learning.
