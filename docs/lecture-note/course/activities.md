## In class activities

- **Quiz**: Each lecture begins with a short paper‑based quiz reviewing the previous week’s material, graded immediately when possible, followed by a discussion of common mistakes at the end of the lecture.
- **Pen‑and‑Paper Exercise**: Before the lecture, students complete a brief exercise to practice key concepts, then discuss solutions in class while the instructor synthesizes the answers.
- **Lecture**: In class lectures are delivered by the instructor.
- **Network of the Week**: Weekly, a student or group presents a 10‑minute paper on a network‑related topic of their choice.
- **Coding**: Each module includes a Python coding exercise (using Marimo notebooks) to apply the concepts to real data.

## Homework

- **Coding assignment**: Every module comes with a coding assignment. The assignment will be distributed via [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).
Students will submit their solutions to the assignment via GitHub and get automatic grading.

- **LLM Quiz Challenge**: Every assignment also includes a task of formulating two quiz questions and correct answers. These quiz questions will be taken by a large language model that learns the course content without seeing the correct answers. The students pass the test if they can generate questions that LLM fails to answer correctly.

## Project

- **Project Proposal**: The students will submit a project proposal on the course content.
- **Project Paper**: The students will submit a project paper on the course content.
- **Project Presentation**: The students will present their project.

## Exam

A final exam will be given at the end of the course during the exam period. This exam will be a take-home exam, and will be distributed via Brightspace.
