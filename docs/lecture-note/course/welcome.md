# Welcome to Advanced Network Science!

Welcome to the course! In this class, we will explore the fascinating world of **networks**—from the social connections that shape our lives to the complex systems that power the internet, biology, and beyond.

This course is designed to provide you with both a **theoretical foundation** and **hands-on experience** in network science. You will learn how to analyze, model, and interpret network data using Python, and apply these skills to real-world problems.

## What to Expect

- **Engaging Lectures:** Each week, we’ll dive into key concepts in network science, supported by interactive discussions and in-class activities.
- **Hands-on Coding:** You’ll work with real network data using Python and modern data science tools.
- **Collaborative Learning:** Participate in group activities, discussions, and our dedicated [Discord server](discord.md) for Q&A and support.
- **Projects and Assignments:** Apply your knowledge through coding assignments, quizzes, and a final project.
- **Support:** Get help from the instructor, TA, and our AI tutor, Minidora.
