## Learning Philosophy

> "Don't think! Feeeeeel" - Bruce Lee, *Enter the Dragon*

This quote guides our approach. Rather than just memorizing formulas, you'll **feel** network concepts through:

- **Hands-on coding** with real network data
- **Pen-and-paper exercises** to build intuition
- **Interactive visualizations** to see patterns emerge
- **Weekly quizzes** to reinforce understanding
