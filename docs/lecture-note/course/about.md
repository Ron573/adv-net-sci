Networks are everywhereâ€”from the Internet connecting billions of devices to the social connections that shape our daily lives. This course explores network data analysis from the ground up, combining hands-on coding with theoretical foundations to unlock the secrets of complex systems.

## About us


### Instructor

::: {#first-column}
Welcome! My name is Sadamori Kojaku, the instructor of this course.
I started my career as a computer scientist but couldn't resist to fall in love with Network Science right after I got Ph.D.
Network Science is about a science on networks, and networks appear in many different forms in our daily lives.
The internet, social media, and biological networks, power grid, and you name it.
But when we abstract them into a bunch of dots connected by lines, we can compare them and understand them in a unified way.
We can study them using the same toolkit no matter what the domain is, and can find universal patterns and principles that govern seemingly different systems.
Sounds fun, right ðŸ˜‰?

This course will guide you through the fascinating world of networks, from foundational theory to hands-on coding and real-world applications.
I hope you will enjoy and find the course useful in your future endeavors.
