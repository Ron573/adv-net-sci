## Course Overview

- **Instructor:** Sadamori Kojaku (Âπ∏Ëã•ÂÆåÂ£Æ)
- **Email:** skojaku@binghamton.edu
- **Office Hours:** Monday 10:00-14:00
- **Course Website:** [https://skojaku.github.io/adv-net-sci](https://skojaku.github.io/adv-net-sci)


## Let's start with a story... ü¶†

::: {.callout-note title = "Question:"}

2009: H1N1 pandemic spreads globally

Do you remember which countries were infected first and second?

:::

Think about it... discuss with your neighbor for 30 seconds

::: {.incremental}

- **Your predictions:**

  - Geographic distance matters?
  - Nearby countries first?
  - Then spreading outward in circles?

- *Let's hear some thoughts...*

:::

## Answer

::: {.callout-tip title = "Answer:"}

- First: United States

- Second: **Spain**

:::

## Here's what actually happened...

<img src="https://www.science.org/cms/10.1126/science.1245200/asset/59290a15-76de-4a0f-9107-259201f98bcf/assets/graphic/342_1337_f1.jpeg" style="width: 100%; max-width: none; margin-bottom: 20px;">

**Question:** What do you notice? Does this match your prediction?

---

**Key insight:** Network structure (air travel) determined spread, not geography!

<img src="https://www.science.org/cms/10.1126/science.1245200/asset/66d5a7ec-a683-4135-af2f-149c91007e48/assets/graphic/342_1337_f2.jpeg" style="width: 100%; max-width: none; margin-bottom: 20px;">

    When is the global clustering not a
    good representation of the network?
    """
answer = """
    When the network is degree
    heterogeneous. This is because
    a single hub can create
    substantially many triangles
    in the network, not
    representing the number of
    triangles typical nodes
    in the network form.

# The K√∂nigsberg Bridge Puzzle üåâ

![](https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2022/02/bridges-with-water.png)

- 18th century puzzle in K√∂nigsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) üá©üá™
- City had 7 bridges connecting 2 islands and mainland üèôÔ∏è
- **Challenge**: Find a route that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to start üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

##

## Your turn! üß©

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {.callout-note title = "Challenge:"}
**Find a route that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to start**

How would YOU approach this?
:::

*Take 30 seconds - think about your strategy*

::: {.incremental}
- **Your approaches:**
  - Trial and error?
  - Start from a specific place?
  - Look for patterns?
  - Something mathematical?
- *Let's hear 2-3 different strategies...*

## Euler's Revolutionary Approach üß†

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.callout-note title = "Question:"}
**What if we ignore all the physical details?**

What do you see in this transformation?
:::

*Turn to your neighbor - what's the key insight?*

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](../lecture-note/m01-euler_tour/tikz-tex/c39860e7fa7562ba1d021b22b78e66cba5a9f51d/c39860e7fa7562ba1d021b22b78e66cba5a9f51d.svg){width=100% fig-align="center"}
:::

::::

## The Breakthrough Insight ‚ú®

::: {.callout-tip title = "Answer:"}
**Euler realized:** Only connections matter, not physical details!

- Landmasses ‚Üí **dots** (nodes)
- Bridges ‚Üí **lines** (edges)
:::

**Why is this abstraction so powerful?**

*This was the birth of graph theory and network science!*

##

# Pen and Paper Exercise üìù

- Let's work on a pen-and-paper [exercise](http://estebanmoro.org/pdf/netsci_for_kids/the_konisberg_bridges.pdf) üìÑ
- Let's form a group of 3-4 people and discuss the solution together.

**Try to discover Euler's insights yourself first!**

##

## Euler's Degree-Based Reasoning üßÆ

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {.callout-note title = "Question:"}
**Count with me:** How many bridges connect to each landmass?

*Point to each area - let's count together...*
:::

::: {.incremental}
- A: **3** bridges
- B: **5** bridges
- C: **3** bridges
- D: **3** bridges
- *What do you notice about these numbers?*

## The Walking Logic üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

::: {.callout-note title = "Think About It:"}
**If you walk through a node, what happens?**

You enter on one edge, leave on another...
:::

::: {.incremental}
- **Even number of edges**: Enter/leave perfectly ‚úÖ
- **Odd number**: One edge "left over" ‚ùå
- **Question:** Where can those "leftover" edges be?
- *Only at start/end points!*
:::

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

:::

::::

##

## The Moment of Truth üèÜ

::: {.callout-note title = "Question:"}
**We found that K√∂nigsberg has 4 odd-degree nodes...**

But Euler's theorem says:
- **0 odd nodes** ‚Üí Euler circuit possible ‚úÖ
- **2 odd nodes** ‚Üí Euler path possible ‚úÖ
- **More than 2** ‚Üí ?

**What does this mean for K√∂nigsberg?**
:::

*What's your verdict?*

## Euler's Path Theorem üèÜ

::: {.callout-tip title = "Answer:"}
**An Euler path/circuit exists if and only if:**

1. **Graph is connected**, **AND**
2. **Either:**
   - All nodes have even degree (**Euler circuit**)
   - Exactly two nodes have odd degree (**Euler path**)

**K√∂nigsberg verdict**: 4 odd-degree nodes ‚Üí **IMPOSSIBLE!** üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
:::

**How do you think the townspeople reacted to this news?**

##

## Network Terminology üìö

::: {.callout-note title = "Question:"}
**What's the difference between these terms?**

Which one did K√∂nigsberg citizens actually want?
:::

::: {.incremental}
- **Walk**: Any sequence of connected nodes (can repeat)
- **Trail**: Walk without repeating edges (Euler trail) ‚Üê *This is key!*
- **Path**: Walk without repeating nodes
- **Circuit**: Closed trail (starts/ends at same node)
- **Cycle**: Closed path
:::

::: {.callout-tip title = "Answer:"}
**K√∂nigsberg sought an Euler circuit!**

A closed trail that uses every edge exactly once.
:::

##

## Tragic Irony: The Bridges' Fate üèôÔ∏èüí£

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {.callout-note title = "Historical Twist:"}
**During WWII, Allied forces bombarded K√∂nigsberg**

Two of the seven bridges were destroyed üí•
:::

::: {.incremental}
- **The irony**: This destruction finally made an Euler path possible! ‚úÖ
- **The city**: Renamed Kaliningrad, now Russian territory üá∑üá∫
- **The math**: Sometimes tragedy solves puzzles üò¢
:::

**What does this teach us about real-world networks?**

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

## üíª Coding Time: Networks in Code! üåê

::: {.callout-note title = "Next Steps:"}
[Let's represent networks with Python!](https://skojaku.github.io/adv-net-sci/m01-euler_tour/how-to-code-network.html) üêç

We'll learn how computers store and analyze networks
:::

## Key Takeaways üéØ

::: {.incremental}
- **Mathematical abstraction**: Focus on structure, not physical details
- **Euler's theorem**: Degree constraints determine network traversability
- **Network terminology**: Walks, trails, paths, circuits, and cycles
- **Historical impact**: From recreational puzzle to foundation of network science
- **Modern relevance**: GPS navigation, internet routing, social networks
