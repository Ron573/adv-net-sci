## Course Overview

- **Instructor:** Sadamori Kojaku (Âπ∏Ëã•ÂÆåÂ£Æ)
- **Email:** skojaku@binghamton.edu
- **Office Hours:** Monday 10:00-14:00
- **Course Website:** [https://skojaku.github.io/adv-net-sci](https://skojaku.github.io/adv-net-sci)


## Let's start with a story... ü¶†

::: {.callout-note title = "Question:"}

2009: H1N1 pandemic spreads globally

Do you remember which countries were infected first and second?

:::

Think about it... discuss with your neighbor for 30 seconds

::: {.incremental}

- **Your predictions:**

  - Geographic distance matters?
  - Nearby countries first?
  - Then spreading outward in circles?

- *Let's hear some thoughts...*

:::

## Answer

::: {.callout-tip title = "Answer:"}

- First: United States

- Second: **Spain**

:::

## Here's what actually happened...

<img src="https://www.science.org/cms/10.1126/science.1245200/asset/59290a15-76de-4a0f-9107-259201f98bcf/assets/graphic/342_1337_f1.jpeg" style="width: 100%; max-width: none; margin-bottom: 20px;">

**Question:** What do you notice? Does this match your prediction?

---

**Key insight:** Network structure (air travel) determined spread, not geography!

<img src="https://www.science.org/cms/10.1126/science.1245200/asset/66d5a7ec-a683-4135-af2f-149c91007e48/assets/graphic/342_1337_f2.jpeg" style="width: 100%; max-width: none; margin-bottom: 20px;">


## Quick Exercise: Spot the Networks! üëÄ

::: {.callout-note title = "Challenge:"}
**Look around you right now...**

What networks do you interact with daily?

*Take 1 minute - list as many networks as you can*

### Euler's Revolutionary Approach üß†

**What if we ignore all the physical details? üôÇ **

What do you see in this transformation?
*What's the key insight?*


![](https://towardsdatascience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/15n0gkvpktkGYtAase5oYuw-1.png){width=800 fig-align="center"}

## The Breakthrough Insight ‚ú®

**Euler realized:** Only connections matter, not physical details!

- Landmasses ‚Üí **dots** (nodes)
- Bridges ‚Üí **lines** (edges)

**Abstraction is the a cornerstone of Network Science**

*This was the birth of graph theory and network science!*

## Euler's Reasoning üßÆ

**If you walk through a node, what happens?**

You enter on one edge, leave on another...

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.incremental}
- **Even number of edges**: Enter/leave perfectly ‚úÖ
- **Odd number**: One edge "left over" ‚ùå
- **Question:** Where can those "leftover" edges be?
- *Only at start/end points!*

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Euler's Path Theorem üèÜ

::: {.callout-tip title = "Answer:"}
An Euler path exists if and only if:

1. Graph is connected, AND

2. Either:
   - All nodes have even degree
   - Exactly two nodes have odd degree

K√∂nigsberg verdict: 4 odd-degree nodes ‚Üí **IMPOSSIBLE!**
:::

## Aftermath


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

The story takes a sobering turn during World War II. In 1944, K√∂nigsberg was heavily bombed by Allied forces, and later captured by the Soviet Union. Two of the seven historic bridges were destroyed in the bombardment.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](./seven-bridge-bombared.png){width=100% fig-align="center"}

:::

::::


---

::: {.callout-note title = "Question:"}

In the previous question, we learned the condition for the possibility to cross each bridge exactly once.

Now, let's also add a new condition: *[Return to the starting point]{.red-text}.*

How does this change the condition for the possibility?

:::

*Turn to your neighbor - give specific answers for 30 seconds*

```{dot}
//| fig-width: 4

  A -- C;
  A -- D;
  B -- C;

}
```

---


::: {.callout-tip title = "Answer:"}

1. Graph is connected, AND

2. Either:
   - All nodes have even degree
   - ~~Exactly two nodes have odd degree~~

This is called an [Euler circuit]{.red-text}.

:::

*Why we cannot have odd-degree nodes?*

---

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Walk**: Any sequence of connected nodes

- **Path**: Walks without repeated nodes

- **Circuit**: Paths that return to the starting point

- **Trail**: Paths without repeated edges

- **Cycle**: Trails that return to the starting point

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}


```{dot}
//| fig-width: 4
//| fig-height: 6

*Question: Are trails always paths? Are paths always trails?*


## Examples

::: {.callout-note title = "Question:"}

What are the real-world examples of the paths and trails?

:::


::: {.incremental}

- **Path**: A travel itinerary that visits each city exactly once
- **Trail**: A mail carrier's route that visits each street exactly once

:::

## Network Connectivity üîó

**Context:** We've learned about Euler's theorem, but there's a hidden assumption...

::: {.callout-note title = "Question:"}
**Look at Euler's conditions again:**

1. The graph is **connected**, AND
2. Either all nodes have even degree OR exactly two have odd degree

**What if the network is NOT connected?**
:::


## What Does "Connected" Really Mean? ü§î

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {.callout-tip title = "Connected Network"}
**Definition:** A network is **connected** if there is a path between every pair of nodes.
:::

**Think about it:** Your campus network

- Can you walk from any building to any other building? (Yes)
- What if construction blocks some walkways? (Maybe)

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

```{dot}
//| fig-width: 4
//| fig-height: 4
//| fig-align: center
graph Connected {
  layout=neato
  overlap=false
  sep=0.8

  A [pos="0,2!", shape=circle, fillcolor="#e1f5fe", style="filled"];
  B [pos="2,2!", shape=circle, fillcolor="#fff3e0", style="filled"];
  C [pos="1,0!", shape=circle, fillcolor="#f3e5f5", style="filled"];
  D [pos="3,0!", shape=circle, fillcolor="#e8f5e8", style="filled"];

  A -- B;
  B -- C;
  C -- D;
  A -- C;
}
```

:::

::::

*Connected: Can reach any node from any other*

## Connected Component

::: {.callout-tip title = "Connected Component"}

**Definition:** A connected component is a maximal set of nodes where every node can reach every other node within that set.

:::

![](./connected-component.jpg){width=100% fig-align="center"}


*Question: Is a single node a connected component?*

## The Giant Component

::: {.callout-note title = "Question:"}
**In large real-world networks, what would you expect?**

- Many tiny components of 2-3 nodes?
- One huge component containing most nodes?
- All components roughly equal size?
:::

::: {.incremental}
- **Giant component:** The largest connected component
- **Contains:** A significant fraction of all nodes in the network
- **Real examples:**
  - The "main" internet (billions of connected devices)
  - The largest friendship network on Facebook
  - The core scientific collaboration network
:::

## Directed Networks: Two Types of Connectivity üîÑ

**Context:** What if edges have direction? (Think Twitter follows, webpage links)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Strong Connectivity üí™
::: {.callout-tip title = "Strong"}
**Every node can reach every other node following edge directions**
:::

```{dot}
//| fig-width: 4
//| fig-height: 3
//| fig-align: center
digraph Strong {
  layout=circo

  A [shape=circle, fillcolor="#e1f5fe", style="filled"];
  B [shape=circle, fillcolor="#fff3e0", style="filled"];
  C [shape=circle, fillcolor="#f3e5f5", style="filled"];

  A -> B -> C -> A;
}
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Weak Connectivity ü§ù
::: {.callout-tip title = "Weak"}
**Connected if we ignore edge directions**
:::

```{dot}
//| fig-width: 4
//| fig-height: 3
//| fig-align: center
digraph Weak {
  layout=circo

  A [shape=circle, fillcolor="#ffcdd2", style="filled"];
  B [shape=circle, fillcolor="#fff3e0", style="filled"];
  C [shape=circle, fillcolor="#c8e6c9", style="filled"];

  A -> B -> C;
}
```

:::

::::

**Question:** Is every strongly connected component also weakly connected?

## Why Connectivity Matters for Euler üåâ

::: {.callout-note title = "Back to K√∂nigsberg:"}
**Why did Euler require the graph to be connected?**
:::

::: {.incremental}
- **If disconnected:** You can't reach all bridges from a single starting point
- **Euler path impossible:** Can't cross bridges you can't reach
- **Component-wise analysis:** Could have Euler paths within each component
- **Real insight:** Connectivity is a prerequisite for global network properties
:::

**This applies everywhere:**
- Internet routing needs connectivity
- Disease spread requires contact networks
- Information flow needs communication paths
