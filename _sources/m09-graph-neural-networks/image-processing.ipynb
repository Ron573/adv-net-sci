    "To approach the problem, let us first remind that an image is a matrix of pixels. Each pixel has RGB values, each of which represents the intensity of red, green, and blue color. To simplify the problem, we focus on grayscale images, in which each pixel has only one value representing the brightness. In this case, an image can be represented as a 2D matrix, where each element in the matrix represents the brightness of a pixel.\n",
