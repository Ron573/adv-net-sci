    "# Community detection (pattern matching)\n",
    "\n",
    "Community detection is an abstract unsupervised problem. It is abstract because there is no clear-cut definition or ground truth to compare against. The concept of a community in a network is subjective and highly context-dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classical approach to community detection is based on *pattern matching*.\n",
    "Namely, we first explicitly define a community by a specific connectivity pattern of its members. Then, we search for these communities in the network.\n",

    "\n",
    "Perhaps, the strictest definition of a community is a *clique*: a group of nodes all connected to each other. Examples include triangles (3-node cliques) and fully-connected squares (4-node cliques).\n",
    "However, cliques are often too rigid for real-world networks. In social networks, for instance, large groups of friends rarely have every member connected to every other, yet we want to accept such \"in-perfect\" social circles as communities.\n",
    "This leads to the idea of relaxed versions of cliques, called **pseudo-cliques**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-cliques are defined by relaxing at least one of the following three dimensions of strictness:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Degree: Not all nodes need to connect to every other node.\n",
    "   - **$k$-plex**: each node connects to all but $k$ others in the group {footcite}`seidman1978graph`.\n",
    "   - **$k$-core**: each node connects to $k$ others in the group {footcite}`seidman1983network`.\n",
    "2. Density: The overall connection density can be lower.\n",
    "   - **$\\rho$-dense subgraphs**, with a minimum edge density of $\\rho$ {footcite}`goldberg1984finding`.\n",
    "3. Distance: Nodes can be further apart.\n",
    "   - **$n$-clique**, where all nodes are within n steps of each other {footcite}`luce1950connectivity`.\n",
    "4. Combination of the above:\n",
    "   - **n-clan** and **n-club** {footcite}`mokken1979cliques`\n",
    "   - **$k$-truss**, a maximal subgraph where all edges participate in at least $k-2$ triangles {footcite}`saito2008extracting,cohen2009graph,wang2010triangulation`.\n",
    "   - **$\\rho$-dense core**, a subgraph with minimum conductance $\\rho$ {footcite}`koujaku2016dense`.\n",
