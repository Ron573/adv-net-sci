    "# Graph cut\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach from computer science is to treat a community detection problem as an *optimization* problem.\n",
    "An early example is the **graph cut** problem, which asks to find the minimum number of edges to cut the graph into two disconnected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, let us consider cutting the network into two communities. Let $V_1$ and $V_2$ be the set of nodes in the two communities.\n",
    "Then, the cut is the number of edges between the two communities, which is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\text{Cut}(V_1, V_2) = \\sum_{i \\in V_1} \\sum_{j \\in V_2} A_{ij}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the community detection problem is translated into **an optimization problem**, with the goal of finding a cut $V_1, V_2$ that minimizes $\\text{Cut}(V_1, V_2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The description of this problem is not complete ðŸ˜ˆ. Let's find out what is missing by playing with the optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",

    "\n",
    "Can you identify what is missing in the description of the graph cut problem? Without this, the best cut is trivial. {{ \"<a href='BASE_URL/vis/community-detection/index.html?scoreType=graphcut&numCommunities=2&randomness=1&dataFile=two-cliques.json'>Graph Cut Problem ðŸŽ®</a>\".replace('BASE_URL', base_url) }}\n",

    "The missing element is a constraint: each community must contain at least one node. Without this, the trivial solution of placing all nodes in a single community would always yield a cut of zero.\n",
