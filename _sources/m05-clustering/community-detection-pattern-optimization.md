# Community detection (optimization)

Another approach from computer science is to treat a community detection problem as an *optimization* problem.
An early example is the **graph cut** problem, which asks to find the minimum number of edges to cut in a graph into two disconnected components.

Specifically, let us first represent a binary label for each node, $x_i \in \{0, 1\}$, where nodes with the same label are in the same community.
The number of edges between the two communities is given by

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Cut}(x)
&= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} A_{ij} \cdot \left( 1- \delta(x_i, x_j) \right)
\end{align}
$$
-  $\delta(x_i, x_j)$ is *the Kronecker delta function*, which is 1 if $x_i = x_j$ and 0 otherwise.
- The factor $1/2$ corrects for double counting of edges due to the double summation.

Now, the community detection problem is translated into **an optimization problem**, with the goal being to find a cut $x$ that minimizes $\text{Cut}(x)$.
The description of this problem is not complete ðŸ˜ˆ. Let's find out what is missing by playing with the optimization problem.
