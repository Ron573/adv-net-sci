# Why should we care networks?

From the vast expanse of the Internet to social networks and protein-protein interactions, *networks* are all around us in nature and society. And, their *connections* do matter in our daily lives. A virus goes viral by going through the *physical contacts* of people. The economics are driven by *trades* between companies. Proteins function by *interacting* with each other.
Networks are the key drivers of many interesting phenomena that do not arise without the networks!

# What is a network?

Networks, in the simplest form, consist of a set of points, called *nodes*, and lines connecting them, called *edges*.
This representation is quite simple. So simple that it is versatile to represent many systems of different kinds.
While representing complex, real-world systems by points and lines is crude, it still captures many interesting properties, as we will see.
