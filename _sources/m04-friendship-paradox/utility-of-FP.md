# Application of the Friendship Paradox

Beyond an interesting trivia, the friendship paradox has many practical applications.


### Epidemiology
One of the cleverest applications is in context of epidemiology. Let's think about the following question:

**Question 1**:
- A disease is spreading through edges (physical contacts) in a social network. A person is infected if at least one of their friends is infected. What is the implication of the friendship paradox on the disease spreading?

- **Question 2**: The disease spreading is predicted and we have a limited number of vaccine to prepare for. Who should we vaccinate first?

- **Question 3**: We do not anything about the structure of social network. How do find out these people without knowning the network structure?

### Marketing and User Surveys

**Question 1**: We have developed a new social networking app but lack the resources to launch it to the public. We want to limit the number of users while targeting influential individuals to maximize the app's impact. How can we use the friendship paradox to achieve this goal?

**Question 2**: We decided to conduct a survey to understand the preferences of our users. We adopt so-called "snow-ball sampling", where we start with a small number of users and expand the sample by inviting friends of the users who have responded to the survey. What is the implication of the friendship paradox on the survey design? Would the results be representative of the population?
