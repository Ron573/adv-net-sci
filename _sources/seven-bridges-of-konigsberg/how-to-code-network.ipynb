    "An atomic element of a network is a node, i.e., a network is a collection of edges which are pairs of nodes.\n",
    "We *label* a unique integer as an identifier for each node. For instance, the bridges of Konigsberg has 4 nodes, and we assign the number 0 to 3 to the nodes. An edge can be represented by a pair of nodes. For instance, the edge between node 0 and node 1 can be represented by the pair `(0, 1)`.\n",
