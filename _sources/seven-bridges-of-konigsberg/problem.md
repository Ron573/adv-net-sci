#  Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg

In this module, we will learn an historical example that leads to the genesis of graph theory in mathematics and modern network science. Through this example, we will learn:
- How to describe a network using mathematical language
- Path, walks, circuits, cycles, connectedness

## A puzzle

Back in 18th century, there was a city called Knigsberg situated on the Pregel River in a historical region of Germany. The city had two large islands connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges.
During their Sunday walks, the citizens pondered a puzzle:


```{Problem}
How could one walk through the city and cross each bridge exactly once?
```

Leonard Euler worked out the solution to this puzzle in 1736. So let's see what he found out.

## From geography to a network

Euler's key insight was to simplify the city into *a network of landmasses connected by bridges*, focusing on the connections rather than the geography.
In fact, the landareas, the positions of the islands and the bridges are nothing to do with the puzzle.
