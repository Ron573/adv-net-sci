    "## Walks, Trails, Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "While we have already used the term **path**, let us make clear its definition, together with other related terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **walk** is a sequence of nodes that are connected to form a continous route in a network. For instance, walk (0, 1, 2, 3) is a walk in the graph of the bridges of Konigsberg. But the sequence (0,2,3,1) is not a walk, because the node 0 is not directly connected to node 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **trail** is a walk with no repeated edge. For instance, walk (0, 1, 2, 3) is also a trail as it does not cross the same edge twice. But walk (0,2,3,1,3) is not a trail due to the repeated edge (1,3).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **path** is a walk without repeated node. For instance, walk (0,1,2,3) is a path. But walk (0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3) is not a path due to the repeated node 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a walk starts and ends at the same node, it is called a **loop*. If the loop is a trail, it is called a **circuit**. If the loop is a path, it is called a **cycle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Question***: Is a path always a trail, and is a trail always a path?\n",

    "- **Shortest Path** is the path with the smallest number of edges (or nodes) between two nodes.\n",
    "A shortest path from node 0 to 2 is (0, 1, 2). Two nodes can have multiple shortest paths e.g., (0, 3, 2).\n",
    "- **The shortest path length** is the number of edges in the shortest path, *not the number of nodes!* ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} Are there **shortest trails** and **shortest walks**?\n",
    "Shortest trails and shortest walks are fundamentally equivalent to shortest paths. A shortest trail must visit each node only once (otherwise it would not be the shortest), and similarly, a shortest walk does not repeat nodes (otherwise it would not be the shortest), both forming a shortest path.\n",

    "## Connectedness\n",
    "\n",
    "- A network is **connected** if there is a path between every pair of nodes.\n",
    "- A network is **disconnected** if there is no path between some pairs of nodes.\n",
    "- **A connected component** of a network is a set of nodes that are connected to each other.\n",
    "- **The giant component** of a network is the largest connected component that contains a significant fraction of nodes in the network (in order of the number of nodes).\n",

    "<img src= \"../figs/connected-component.jpg\" width=\"50%\">\n",

    "\n",
    "## Connectedness in directed networks\n",
    "\n",
    "We call a network is *directed* if the edges have a direction. Example directed networks include the network of Web pages, the network of friendships on X, the network of citations on academic papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a directed network, a walk must follow the edge directions. Paths, trails, and loops extend similarly to directed networks. But one thing to keep in mind: a walk may not be reversible, meaning there can be a walk from one node to another but not vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to two different types of `connectedness` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strong connectedness**: A directed network is said to be strongly connected if there is a path from every node to every other node.\n",
    "- **Weak connectedness**: A directed network is said to be weakly connected if there is a path from every node to every other node on its *undirected* counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{figure-md} connected-components-directed\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src= \"../figs/connected-component-directed.jpg\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "connected components of a network. the nodes with the same color form a connected component.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Is a strongly-connected component always a weakly-connected component?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will learn how to compute the shortest paths and connected components of a network using a library [igraph](https://python.igraph.org/en/stable/)."
