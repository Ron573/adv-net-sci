    "Let's dive into the math behind random walks in a way that's easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're at a node $i$ at time $t$. You randomly choose one of the neighboring nodes to move to, let's call it node $j$. The chance of moving from node $i$ to node $j$ is called the transition probability $p_{ij}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{ij} = \\frac{A_{ij}}{k_i},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $A_{ij}$ is part of the adjacency matrix (which tells us if there's a connection between nodes $i$ and $j$), and $k_i$ is the number of connections (degree) node $i$ has. If our network has $N$ nodes, we have $N \\times N$ transition probabilities, which we can put together in a *transition probability matrix* $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{P} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "p_{11} & p_{12} & \\cdots & p_{1N} \\\\\n",
    "p_{21} & p_{22} & \\cdots & p_{2N} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "p_{N1} & p_{N2} & \\cdots & p_{NN}\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix $P$ tells us everything about the random walk process. Using $P$, we can figure out how often we expect to visit each node after taking $T$ steps. For example, the chance of visiting node $j$ after one step from node $i$ is simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{ij} = p_{ij}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to know the chance of visiting node $j$ after **two steps** from node $i$, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left(\\mathbf{P}^{2}\\right)_{ij} = \\sum_{k} P_{ik} P_{kj}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this down:\n",
    "- The sum is over all possible intermediate nodes $k$.\n",
    "- $P_{ik}P_{kj}$ is the chance of moving from node $i$ to node $k$, and then from node $k$ to node $j$.\n",
    "- By adding up all these probabilities, we get the total chance of moving from node $i$ to node $j$ in two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the chance of visiting node $j$ after **$T$ steps** from node $i$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left(\\mathbf{P}^{T}\\right)_{ij}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with this, let us consider the long-term behavior of the random walk. We represent $\\mathbf{x}(t) = [x_1(t), \\ldots, x_N(t)]^\\top$ as the probability distribution of being at each node at time $t$. As $T$ becomes very large, $\\left(\\mathbf{P}^{T}\\right)_{ij}$ settles down to a constant value such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{x}(t+1).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an eigenvector equation, and the solution is given by the Perron-Frobenius theorem. For undirected networks, such vector always exists and is called the **stationary distribution** of the random walk. According to the Perron-Frobenius theorem, the solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{x}(\\infty) = \\mathbb{\\pi}, \\; \\mathbf{\\pi} = [\\pi_1, \\ldots, \\pi_N]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\mathbb{\\pi} = [\\pi_1, \\ldots, \\pi_N]$ is the stationary distribution. This means $\\pi_j$ is the long-term probability of being at node $j$. This is an eigenvector equation, and $\\pi_j$ is the left eigenvector of $P$ with eigenvalue 1. For undirected networks, this vector $\\pi$ always exists and is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pi_j = \\frac{k_j}{\\sum_{\\ell} k_\\ell} \\propto k_j.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the probability of being at node $j$ in the long run is proportional to the degree of node $j$. The normalization ensures that the sum of all probabilities is 1, i.e., $\\sum_{j=1}^N \\pi_j = 1$.\n",
