    "# Random Walks\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you walk in a city. You are drunk and your feet have no idea where to go. You just take a step wherever your feet take you. At every intersection, you make a random decision and take a step. This is the core idea of a random walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "While your feet are taking you to a random street, after making many steps and looking back, you will realize that you have been to certain places more frequently than others. If you were to map the frequency of your visits to each street, you will end up with a distribution that tells you about salient structure of the street network. It is surprising that this seemingly random, brainless behavior can tell us something deep about the structure of the city.\n",

    "A random walk in undirected networks is the following process:\n",
    "1. Start at a node $i$\n",
    "2. Randomly choose an edge to traverse to a neighbor node $j$\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 until you have taken $T$ steps.\n",
