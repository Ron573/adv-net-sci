    "Modularity can be intepreted as a random walk perspective. Modularity is given by\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Q = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{ij} \\left( A_{ij} - \\frac{d_i d_j}{2m} \\right) \\delta(c_i, c_j)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ is the number of edges in the network, $A_{ij}$ is the adjacency matrix, $d_i$ is the degree of node $i$, $c_i$ is the community of node $i$, and $\\delta(c_i, c_j)$ is the Kronecker delta function (which is 1 if $c_i = c_j$ and 0 otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite the modularity using the language of random walks as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "Q &= \\sum_{ij} \\left(\\frac{A_{ij}}{2m}  - \\frac{d_i}{2m} \\frac{d_j}{2m} \\right) \\delta(c_i, c_j) \\\\\n",
    "&= \\sum_{ij} \\left(\\pi_i P_{ij}  - \\pi_i \\pi_j \\right) \\delta(c_i, c_j)\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",

    "where $\\pi_i$ is the stationary distribution of the random walk given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pi_i = \\frac{d_i}{2m}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $P_{ij}$ is the transition probability between nodes $i$ and $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Let's break down this derivation step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We start with the original modularity formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$Q = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{ij} \\left( A_{ij} - \\frac{d_i d_j}{2m} \\right) \\delta(c_i, c_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. First, we move the constant $1/(2m)$ to the inside of the parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$Q = \\sum_{ij} \\left(\\frac{A_{ij}}{2m} - \\frac{d_i d_j}{2m^2} \\right) \\delta(c_i, c_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, we recognize that $\\frac{A_{ij}}{2m}$ can be rewritten as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\frac{A_{ij}}{2m} = \\frac{d_i}{2m} \\cdot \\frac{A_{ij}}{d_i} = \\pi_i P_{ij}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We also recognize that $\\frac{d_i}{2m}$ is the stationary distribution of the random walk, which we denote as $\\pi_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\frac{d_i}{2m} = \\pi_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Substituting these into our equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$Q = \\sum_{ij} \\left(\\pi_i P_{ij} - \\pi_i \\pi_j \\right) \\delta(c_i, c_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression suggests that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first term, $\\pi_i P_{ij} \\delta(c_i, c_j)$, represents the probability that a walker is at node $i$ and moves to node $j$ within the same community **by one step**.\n",
    "2. The second term, $\\pi_i \\pi_j$, represents the probability that a walker is at node $i$ and moves to another node $j$ within the same community **after long steps**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, modularity compares short-term and long-term random walk probabilities. High modularity indicates that a random walker is more likely to stay within the same community after one step than after many steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Building on this perspective from random walks, Delvenne et al. {footcite}`delvenne2010stability` extends the modularity by comparing multi-step and long-step transition probabilities of a random walk. This approach, known as \"Markov stability\", shows that the number of steps acts as a \"resolution parameter\" that determines the scale of detectable communities.\n",

    "## PageRank: Interpretation from random walk perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "PageRank can be interpreted from a random walk perspective:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_i = (1-\\beta) \\sum_j P_{ji} c_j + \\beta \\cdot \\frac{1}{N}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $c_i$ is the PageRank of node $i$\n",
    "- $P_{ji}$ is the transition probability from node $j$ to node $i$\n",
    "- $\\beta$ is the teleportation probability\n",
    "- $N$ is the total number of nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation represents a random walk where:\n",
    "1. With probability $(1-\\beta)$, the walker follows a link to the next node.\n",
    "2. With probability $\\beta$, the walker *teleports* to a random node in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PageRank $c_i$ is the stationary distribution of this random walk, representing the long-term probability of finding the walker at node $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This sounds odd at first glance. But it makes sense when you think about what PageRank was invented for, i.e., Web search. It characterizes a web surfer as a random walker that chooses the next page by randomly jumping to a random page with probability $\\beta$ or by following a link to a page with probability $1-\\beta$. The web page with the largest PageRank means that the page is most likely to be visited by this random web surfer.\n",
