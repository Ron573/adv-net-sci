    "One considers that a node is important if it is connected to other important nodes. Yes, it sounds like circular! But it is actually computable! Let us define it more precisely by the following equation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's think about it for a moment. We want our centrality measure to be positive. It wouldn't make much sense to have negative importance! So, we're looking for an eigenvector where all the elements are positive. And a good news is that there's a special eigenvector that fits the bill perfectly.\n",

    "Let's put on a math hat to concretely define the hub and authority centralities.\n",
    "We introduce two vectors, $x_i$ and $y_i$, to denote the hub and authority centralities of node $i$, respectively. Following the idea of eigenvector centrality, we can define the hub and authority centralities as follows:\n",
