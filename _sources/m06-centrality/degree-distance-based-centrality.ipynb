    "# What is centrality?\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered who the most popular person in your school is? Or which idea is the most important in a subject? Or maybe which movie everyone's talking about right now?\n",
    "These questions are all about finding out what's important in a network of people, ideas, or things. In network science, we call this *centrality.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Centrality or *importance* is a question of how important a node is in a network.\n",
    "But the notion of *importance* is somewhat vague.\n",
    "In what sense we say a node is important?\n",
    "Answering this question needs a specific *context*, and there are many contexts in which the *importance* is defined.\n",

    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest form of cnetrality is *degree centrality*. It is just the count of the number of edges connected to a node (i.e., the number of neighbors, or *degree* in network science terminology). The most important node is thus the one with the highest degree.\n",

    "Let's talk about an ancient Roman monument called the *Milliarium Aureum*, also known as the *Golden Milestone*.\n",
    "It was the starting point for measuring distances on all major roads in the Roman Empire.\n",
    "Emperor Augustus built it when Rome changed from a republic to an empire.\n",
    "The monument not only marked the distances but also represent a centralization of power, where Rome transitioned from a Republic to an Empire.\n",
    "Perhaps the Romans understood the importance of being central in terms of distance, and this concept can be applied to define *centrality* in networks.\n",

    "### Closeness centrality\n",
    "**Closenes centrality** is a measure of how close a node is to all other nodes in the network. A node is central if it is close to all other nodes, which is operationally defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of nodes in the network. The numerator, $N - 1$, is the normalization factor to make the centrality have a maximum value of 1.\n",

    "### Harmonic centrality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Harmonic Centrality** is a measure that adjusts closeness centrality to work even in disconnected networks. The problem with closeness centrality is that it cannot handle disconnected networks. When a network is disconnected, some nodes can't reach others, making their distance infinite. This causes all centrality values to become zero, which isn't very helpful!\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, Beauchamp {footcite:p}`beauchamp1965improved` came up with a clever solution called *harmonic centrality*. It works even when the network is disconnected.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Eccentricity centrality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eccentricity centrality** is baesd on the farthest distance from a node to any other node. The eccentricity centrality is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_i = \\frac{1}{\\max_{j} \\text{shortest path length from } i \\text{ to } j}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These centrality measures provide different perspectives on the importance of nodes based on their accessibility and reachability within the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central node should be close to all other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closeness centrality captures the notion of \"centrality\" in the network. Namely, a node is *central* if it is close to all other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_i = \\frac{N - 1}{\\sum_{j = 1}^N \\text{shortest path length from } j \\text{ to } i}\n",

    "where $N$ is the number of nodes in the network. The numerator, $N$, is the normalization factor to make the centrality to have the maximum value of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eccentricity centrality\n",
    "\n",
    "Eccentricity centrality is based on the shortest path distance between nodes, just like the closeness centrality, but it is based on the *maximum* distance as opposed to the average distance like in the closeness centrality.\n",

    "### Betweenness centrality\n",
    "\n",
    "Another notion of centrality is *betweenness centrality*. It considers that a node is important if it lies on many shortest paths between other nodes.\n",

    "c_i = \\sum_{j < k} \\frac{\\sigma_{jk}(i)}{\\sigma_{jk}}\n",
